# compile results from class coding round 1 (exclusion screening)
# author(s): CTW (caitlin.t.white@colorado.edu)

# script workflow:
# search G Drive for all instances of exclusion criteria coding form results (as of 12/23/19, there are at least 4-5 copies)
# compare coding results files and distill to unique rows
# prioritize more recent scoring for any papers reviewed twice (e.g. papers re-scored to answer Q8)
# sort: 1) set of papers excluded, 2) final set of papers that make it through to round 2 coding, 3) any scoring that needs follow-up (e.g. conflicting answers)
# output: 
## 1) random-assignly round 2 papers to class list, write out to repo and GDrive round 2 review subfolder
### > 1/29/20: we decided to compromise around logistic ease, reduce bias + make worload manageable: rando subsample 50% papers, make rando groups of 3, each person splits 1/2 of their papers with someone else in their group of three (so in total 2 ppl reviewing same paper for every paper subsampled)
## 2) summary figure out abstracts excluded and why (figure written out to figs subfolder in repository)


# notes:
# 1/15/20 (class meeting): 
## Sierra, Aislyn and Nick confirmed in class: if NA can assume NO in their abstracts questions (code needs to infill)
## we decided everyone will go back and score any NAs for q8 only IFF the paper would otherwise make it round 2
## if abstract is excluded based on some other question, ignore any NAs that exist for that record

# -- RANDOM ASSIGN ROUND 2 PAPERS -----
# write out to csv
# final rules (1/30/20): 
## if reviewed paper in round 1, cannot review same paper in round 2
## add Laura to list of reviewers, Laura should not review Caitlin papers from round 1
## random subsample 50% of abstracts that made it to round 2
## > will start with of all papers, but could divide this out based on journals (have more equal journal rep) or round 1 reviewer (have more equal # abstracts per round 1 reviewer)
## > e.g. trying to avoid lots of abstracts from journal with most abstracts contributed, and lots of abstracts from person who passed on the most abstracts, for example
## randomize groups of 3, each person splits half of their papers with the other 2 in the group so in total all papers have 2 reviewers for round 2

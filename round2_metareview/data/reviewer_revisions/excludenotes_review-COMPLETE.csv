Its main message is proposing a framework, but the authors also apply this framework to a case study, which I based my answers in this survey off of. Between use of terminology I don't know and vague description of the data, I struggled to do this paper justice, I fear.",Bell,2017,ECOSPHERE,"Anthropogenic stressors such as climate change, increased fire frequency, and pollution drive shifts in ecosystem function and resilience. Scientists generally rely on biological indicators of these stressors to signal that ecosystem conditions have been altered. However, these biological indicators are not always capable of being directly related to ecosystem components that provide benefits to humans and/or can be used to evaluate the cost-benefit of a change in health of the component (ecosystem services). Therefore, we developed the STEPS (Stressor-Ecological Production function-final ecosystem Services) Framework to link changes in a biological indicator of a stressor to final ecosystem services. The STEPS Framework produces ""chains"" of ecological components that explore the breadth of impacts resulting from the change in a stressor. Chains are comprised of the biological indicator, the ecological production function (EPF, which uses ecological components to link the biological indicator to a final ecosystem service), and the user group who directly uses, appreciates, or values the component. The framework uses a qualitative score (high, medium, low) to describe the strength of science (SOS) for the relationship between each component in the EPF. We tested the STEPS Framework within a workshop setting using the exceedance of critical loads of air pollution as a model stressor and the Final Ecosystem Goods and Services Classification System (FEGS-CS) to describe final ecosystem services. We identified chains for four modes of ecological response to deposition: aquatic acidification, aquatic eutrophication, terrestrial acidification, and terrestrial eutrophication. The workshop participants identified 183 unique EPFs linking a change in a biological indicator to a FEGS; when accounting for the multiple beneficiaries, we ended with 1104 chains. The SOS scores were effective in identifying chains with the highest confidence ranking as well as those where more research is needed. The STEPS Framework could be adapted to any system in which a stressor is modifying a biological component. The results of the analysis can be used by the social science community to apply valuation measures to multiple or selected chains, providing a comprehensive analysis of the effects of anthropogenic stressors on measures of human well-being."
,,4/22/20,TRUE,Q1,TRUE,FALSE,R_3nkJM8cj2M1w727,SDJ,Accounting for residential propagule pressure improves prediction of urban plant invasion,Maybe,uncertainy in survey notes,FALSE,"They are kind of getting at connectivity with their study question which is about how neighboring residences increase invasive species propagules, which influences their p/a in forests. But they did not measure that connection directly. The ""function"" was a human-mediated invasion pressure"". So kind of the opposite of a function",Davis,2016,ECOSPHERE,"Plant invasions substantially impact the ecosystem services provided by forests in urbanizing regions. Knowing where invasion risk is greatest helps target early detection and eradication efforts, but developing an accurate predictive model of invasive species presence and spread on the basis of habitat suitability remains a challenge due to spatial variation in propagule pressure (the number of individuals released) which is likely conflated with suitability. In addition to neighborhood propagule pressure that originates with propagules dispersing from naturalized populations within invaded habitats, we expect residential propagule pressure arising from the widespread use of exotic plants in the yards of single-family residences to be an important driver of invasions, and to notably improve the predictive accuracy of species distribution models (SDMs). To this end, we collected presence/absence data for a widespread forest invader, Ligustrum sinense (Chinese privet), from 400 stratified random plots located along an urban gradient across the Charlotte, North Carolina metropolitan area. We assessed the relative contribution of residential propagule pressure and neighborhood propagule pressure to improving the predictive performance of a probit SDM for Chinese privet that only contains environmental predictors. Our results indicate that, although the environment-only model predicted the highest geographic area to be at risk of invasion by privet, it also had the highest rate of failure to accurately predict observed privet occurrences as indicated by the omission (incorrectly predicted absence) and commission (incorrectly predicted presence) error rates. Accounting for residential propagule pressure substantially improved model performance by reducing the omission error by nearly 50%, thereby improving upon the ability of the model to predict privet invasion in suboptimal habitat. Given that this increase in detection was accompanied by a decrease in the geographic area predicted at risk, we conclude that SDMs for invasive exotic shrubs and potentially for other synanthropic generalist plants may be highly inefficient when residential propagule pressure is not accounted for. Accounting for residential propagule pressure in models of invasive plants results in a more focused and accurate prediction of the area at risk, thus enabling decision makers to feasibly prioritize regional scale monitoring and control efforts."

It almost seems like it stops at biodiversity but it mentions implications for ES. Also - the paper quantified diversity for animal groups based on weed index. ,Hyvonen,2008,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,"The study aimed at developing an agro-biodiversity indicator based on trophic interactions between 25 common arable weeds and individual groups of farmland birds, pollinators (wild bees), phytophagous insects and insect pests. Each weed species was weighted based on the number of reported linkages with each animal group. Four biodiversity indices based on these weights were constructed and applied to exploring the ecological consequences of long-term changes in weed populations in Finland. Data were used from weed surveys of Finnish spring cereal fields conducted in the 1960s, 1980s and 1990s. The relative importance of weed species varied according to animal groups. Annual weed species able to produce numerous seeds were important for the farmland birds and some perennial weed species were important for the pollinators. The highest number of linkages was established between weed species and phytophagous insects. The number of harmful pest species associated with broad-leaved weeds was low for all species. The general pattern of changes in values of indices over recent decades was similar: there was a marked decline in the values between the 1960s and the 1980s, and a slight increase between the 1980s and the 1990s. These changes were regarded as being a consequence of changes in the intensity of agricultural practices. The slowest recovery of the values was for pollinators. The results suggest that the ecological consequences of changes in the intensity of agriculture can be explored with the aid of a biodiversity indicator based on species interactions. Owing to the differences in the importance of weed species for different animal groups, maintaining weed species richness is necessary to ensure ecosystem services are provided for the higher trophic levels in farmland.

Yard-management decisions impact socio-ecological systems in various ways, for example through irrigation patterns, fertilization or the use of pesticides or through the choice for exotic species that may become invasive over time. Yard-management decisions can also positively influence the presence of pollinators, improve soil quality or even foster small scale 'Wildlife Habitats' that can function as ecological stepping stones to the wider environment.

Understanding the efficacy and rationality of conservation practices on erosion mitigation is critical for contemporary strategy adjustment, which currently is hampered by the unavailability of historical observations on sediment yields at most ungauged catchments. Check dams were built with the primary purpose of sediment retention, while the infilling archives register historical sedimentary dynamics. A 485-cm long sediment core was extracted from a check dam in a restored agricultural catchment in the hilly Loess Plateau. Sedimentary stratigraphy was defined at 5-cm resolutions by continuous equivalent sectioning, and differentiated according to absolute grain-size composition and Cesium-137 (Cs-137) profile. Discernable stratigraphic laminations, featured by a fine-grained layer overlying on a coarse-grained layer, were observed, which were conducted by particle selectivity associated with soil detachment and sediment transport processes. Erosion and sediment dynamics across this semiarid landscape is strictly defined by extreme summer storms with large magnitude, low frequency and short duration. Sediment chronology was determined by ascribing the identified laminations to historical storm events. We found that the core profile showed evidence of at least 11 depositional events, which finally were connected with 11 major storms over the time period 1981-1983. We concluded that integrating stratigraphy differentiation of equivalent core segments along depositional profiles with storm records is diagnostic for inferring historical sedimentary dynamics."

The northwest arid region (NAR) in China is known as one of the most severe soil loss in the world that suffering from wind erosion. Based on the Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWEQ), the spatio-temporal change of wind erosion was identified, and the underlying drivers and influencing factors of soil erosion process were investigated. In addition, the implications of constraint effects in soil erosion control were discussed. The results showed that the wind erosion from 1990 to 2013 was substantially lessened, and the government-aided desertification prevention and control programs, as well as increasing precipitation and decreasing wind speed might have contributed to these trends. The constraint line analyses indicated that the vegetation cover had nonlinear and threshold effects on soil erosion through constraining the water condition (precipitation). Specifically, when the precipitation is below the threshold (approximately 50-100 mm yr(-1) in the NAR), the precipitation (water condition) is not sufficient to maintain a good vegetation cover (about 20-40%), therefore the vegetation cannot efficiently prevent wind erosion. However, once the precipitation exceeds this threshold, the vegetation's sand retention function will enhance and thereby reducing soil loss substantially. Vegetation cover has a lower and an upper threshold for controlling wind erosion. A plant cover lower than 10% does little to reduce wind velocity at the soil surface. The effect of vegetation on reducing wind erosion basically reaches the maximum when plant cover is 40% or above. The constraint effects of precipitation on vegetation cover in the arid region should be considered to improve the efficiency of afforestation and reforestation efforts aiming at mitigating and preventing soil loss."

This is beneficial to urban ecology through its high species diversity, occurrence of endangered and vulnerable native species. Based on a classification of specific plant attributes referenced from literature, provision of food and medicinal resources (77.5%), and aesthetic benefits (72.3%) were the key ecosystem services provided by the species present. Community-driven vertical greenery could function as refugia for native species of conservation interest through providing an additional buffer against further losses in the wild. It also provides immediate opportunities for interactions between humans and nature. This study finds that corridors with larger areas and simpler geometries typically hold a higher abundance of plant pots.

The capacity of degraded grasslands to recover biomass is uncertain because legacies of degradation can strongly influence the demographic processes controlling ecosystem recovery. We develop a conceptual framework for understanding biomass carbon (C) flux in degraded perennial grassland based on demographic processes of growth, mortality and recruitment. We apply this framework to 22 years of data from Chionochloa- and Festuca-dominated perennial tussock grassland in the South Island high country, sampling two grazed sites and two sites retired from domestic grazing. Total biomass C stocks were assessed at site level using 174 temporary plots measured in 1989 and 2011. Long-term demographics were monitored using 24 permanent plots in which 7213 individual tussocks were tagged and monitored every 1-5 years from 1989 to 2011. Although biomass C stocks were generally low (2159 +/- 494 kg C ha(-1)), there was a significant increase in total biomass C over the 22-year period at the north-facing retired site of 92 +/- 47 kg C ha(-1) year(-1). Increases in total biomass C were generally due to recruitment and growth of tall tussock (Chionochloa spp.) and/or woody shrubs. Biomass C stock in grazed sites, and the retired south-facing site, declined by up to 65 kg C ha(-1) year(-1) or remained constant. Declines were due to dieback of the dominant short tussock (Festucanovae-zelandiae) across all treatments, and a lack of recruitment of tall tussock and shrub species. Our results suggest that retirement from grazing was not sufficient to ensure total biomass C gains after 22 years, and highlight the roles of recruitment limitation, shrub establishment and management history in controlling ecosystem recovery."

We present a novel methodology for analysing the contribution of woodland ecosystem services (ES) to rural wellbeing and poverty alleviation, which takes into account access mechanisms to ES, trade-offs between ES, and human response options. Using a participatory approach, a set of land use change scenarios were translated into a probabilistic model that integrates biophysical and social data. Our findings suggest that in highly forested areas woodland degradation does not have a critical impact on the local use of the three ES studied: charcoal, firewood and grass. Social factors show the largest impact on the quantity of charcoal produced, e.g. female headed households experience the greatest barriers to access charcoal production. Participating in forest associations and diversifying income activities lead to greater charcoal production. Results show that charcoal production increases some aspects of well-being (e.g. household assets), but does not decrease acute multidimensional poverty. Great efforts are required to reach a charcoal production system that alleviates poverty, improves environmental sustainability, and provides a reliable charcoal supply."

The estimation of eco-environment benefit contributes to clarify the ecological and environmental changes caused by land reclamation and to provide useful information for policy-makers concerned with sustainable development. The aim of this study is to investigate variations in eco-environment benefit in response to land use changes during land reclamation. The West dump, one of the earliest regions to implement ecological restoration in Liaoning Province, is selected as the study area. The widely used methods for eco-environment benefits based on the land use change were proposed and applied to the West dump in 2004, 2009, and 2014. The total eco-environment benefits in study areas were 0.98 million dollars in 2004, 1.39 million dollars in 2009, and 1.43 million dollars in 2014, with an increase of 0.41 million dollars from 2004 to 2009 mainly because of the increasing areas of artificial woodland and reclaimed cropland. The combined eco-environment benefits of artificial woodland, improved grassland, and reclaimed cropland were over 90% of the total benefits. Soil formation and protection, biodiversity protection, and gas regulation were the top three functions with high eco-environment benefits, contributing about half of the total eco-environment benefits. The results suggest that future studies estimating eco-environment benefits should pay more attention to ecosystems in fragile ecological regions where various human interferences happen frequently.

Our results showed that from the creek bottom to flat soil water content declined (F-3,F-60 = 93.8, p < 0.001), and the variations of other sediment physical and chemical properties associated with the change of soil water content were significant among the microhabitats on the creek sections (p < 0.001 for pH, conductivity, and grain size). No crab burrows were found at the creek bottom. The burrows on the slope were smaller in size (p < 0 001 for burrow opening diamater) while the density was higher than that at the edge and on the flat (F-2,F-45 = 31.2, p < 0.001). Moreover, although the correlations between burrow distribution and sediment properties varied among the microhabitats on the creek sections, crabs generally selected relatively solid sediments to build their burrows. On the slope, there was a significantly negative relationship between burrow density and soil water content (r(2) = 0.53, p < 0.001). At the edge, the correlation between total burrow opening area and soil water content was significantly negative (r(2) = 0.44. p < 0.002). The density of small crab burrows (<10 mm) was greater, but that of large burrows (>10 mm) was lower in tidal creeks than in non-creek habitats. Therefore, sediment properties showed a gradual transition from hydrophytic to terrestrial environments on the creek section, which caused significant differences of burrow distribution among the microhabitats. The creeks of tidal salt marshes could affect ecological processes and functioning through affecting crab burrows. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

We developed a methodology based on statistical modeling, spatial prediction, and mapping for the relative growth of the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis. We evaluated the performance of different modeling techniques and classification schemes using empirical measurements of growth from 144 sampling sites and data on biological, chemical, and physical predictors.

Such information is fundamental for maritime spatial planning and ecosystem-based management and its importance is likely to increase in the future.

European floodplain landscapes are particularly useful for such approach as they originally provided a high variety and quantity of ESS that has declined due to the strong human impact these landscapes have experienced. We provide an overview of the effects of floodplain management options on landscape multifunctionality by assessing the effects of 38 floodplain management interventions on 21 relevant ESS, as well as on overall ESS supply. We found that restoration and rehabilitation consistently increased the multifunctionality of the landscape by enhancing supply of provisioning, regulation/maintenance, and cultural services. In contrast, conventional technical regulation measures and interventions related to extraction, infrastructure and intensive land use cause decrease in multifunctionality and negative effects for the supply of all three aspects of ESS.

Several different biological indicators were triggered in different ecosystems, including grasses and/or forbs (33% of all pathways), mycorrhizal communities (22%), tree species (21%), and lichen biodiversity (11%). Ecoregions with higher deposition rates for longer periods tended to have more numerous and varied ecological impacts (e.g., Eastern Temperate Forests, eight biological indicators) as opposed to other ecoregions (e.g., North American Deserts and Marine West Coast Forests each with one biological indicator). Nonetheless, although ecoregions differed by ecological effects from terrestrial eutrophication, the number of FEGS and beneficiaries impacted was similar across ecoregions.

In addition, the effects of gut passage on seed germination, in combination with the capacity of flying foxes to travel long distances, may substantially contribute to the efficiency of flying foxes as seed dispersers."

Although broad consensus has been reached regarding the positive BEF relationship, a number of important challenges remain unanswered. These primarily concern the underlying mechanisms by which diversity increases resilience and community stability, particularly the relative importance of statistical averaging and functional complementarity. Our understanding of these mechanisms relies heavily on theoretical and experimental studies, yet the degree to which theory adequately explains the dynamics and stability of natural ecosystems is largely unknown, especially in marine ecosystems. Using modelling and a unique 60-year dataset covering multiple trophic levels, we show that the pronounced multi-decadal variability of the Southern California Current System (SCCS) does not represent fundamental changes in ecosystem functioning, but a linear response to key environmental drivers channelled through bottom-up and physical control. Furthermore, we show strong temporal asynchrony between key species or functional groups within multiple trophic levels caused by opposite responses to these drivers. We argue that functional complementarity is the primary mechanism reducing community variability and promoting resilience and stability in the SCCS."

However, the relationship between the community responses of soil microbes and variation in tree mixtures vs functional composition remains poorly understood. We investigated soil biochemical properties and soil microbial resistance and resilience to drought in three 4-year-old tree monocultures (Acer saccharum Marsh, Larix laricina (Duroi) K. Koch and Pinus strobus L.) and two tree species combinations (L.laricina/A.saccharum and L.laricina/P.strobus) planted in a high-density tree field experiment located in southern Quebec, Canada. The experimentally imposed drought stress consisted of maintaining soil material for 30days at 25% of water-holding capacity (WHC). Microbial biomass was assessed immediately after the water stress (resistance) and 15 and 30days following drought (resilience). Results showed that tree communities influenced soil chemistry, soil respirometry properties and microbial resistance and resilience. We measured significant non-additive (i.e. both synergistic and antagonistic) effects of mixing tree species in some of the soil biochemical properties measured, mostly in the L.laricina/A.saccharum mixture. However, we did not find non-additive effects of tree mixtures on microbial resistance and resilience. A structural equation modelling analysis revealed that resistance and resilience were mostly modulated by direct effects of community-weighted means (CWM) of leaf litter lignin content and mineralizable N, and by indirect links from tree density and CWM of leaf litter N content via mineralizable N. This study suggests that tree species identity surpassed species mixtures as a key driver of soil microbial resistance and resilience. We showed a trade-off between microbial resistance and resilience in soil food webs, which is consistent with ecological theory. Our results indicate that differences in functional traits between tree species may rapidly be reflected in divergent soil biochemical properties and that these differences can in turn drive soil microbial resistance and resilience to drought."

High nitrous oxide emissions have been identified in riparian zones used for N removal and could be a concern which would diminish their overall environmental benefit. However, it has been shown in riparian zones in the Rhine and Scheldt catchment that nitrous oxide emissions mainly occur when soil pH values are lower than 5.

Existing wetlands are quite vulnerable for nutrient loading, depending on their natural nutrient richness. Oligotrophic and mesotrophic wetlands such as bogs and fens are negatively affected by nutrient loadings > 4 g N m(-2) y(-1) and 0.5 g P m(-2) y(-1), which lead to loss of diversity and characteristic species.

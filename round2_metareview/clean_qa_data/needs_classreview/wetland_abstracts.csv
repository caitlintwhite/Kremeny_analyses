Soil and water conservation practices can be used to enhance the capacity of watersheds to produce these services. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of agricultural conservation practices on water and sediment yield using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The study area was Sasumua Watershed (107 km(2) [43 mi(2)]), where land degradation has affected watershed's capacity to regulate flow and maintain water quality. The model was calibrated and validated for streamflow at the watershed outlet. Data on annual average erosion rates for the area was used to constrain soil erodibility factor (KUSLE) and practice erodibility factor (PUSLE) parameters during sediment calibration while measured three month sediment concentration data was used for validation. Model performance was assessed using the coefficient of determination (r(2)), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (ENS) and percent bias (PBIAS). Results gave monthly streamflow r(2) values of 0.80 and 0.85, ENS values of 0.74 and 0.81, and PBIAS values of +/- 5% and +/- 6% during the calibration and validation. The model also satisfactorily simulated daily sediment concentrations with an r(2) value of 0.54. However, ENS and PBIAS values were low, which was attributed to the short duration of measurement. The validated model was used to simulate sediment yield for the period 1970 to 2010. Mean annual watershed sediment yield was 40,934 t y(-1) (9 0,243,096 lb yr(-1)). The impacts of filter strips, contour farming, parallel terraces, grassed waterways, and their combinations on water and sediment yield were simulated by adjusting relevant model parameters. The effectiveness of filter strips increased nonlinearly with width being optimum at 30 m (98.4 ft). A combination of 30 m (98.4 ft) wide filter strips and grassed waterways reduced sediment yield by 80%; parallel terraces, 10 m (32.8 ft) filter strips, and grassed waterways reduced sediment yield by 75%; 10 m (32.8 ft) filter strips and grassed waterways reduced yield by 73%; contour farming and grassed waterways reduced yield by 66%; and grassed waterways reduced yield by only 54%. Parallel terraces reduced surface runoff by 20% and increased base flow by 12%, while contour farming reduced surface runoff by 12% and increased base flow by 6.5%. Implementation of conservation practices can reduce sediment yield and increase water yield marginally. The results give an insight into the implications of the present land use management practices and can be used to devise ecologically sound watershed management and development plans."

Anticipating change in ecosystem services is a pressing challenge that requires understanding how species respond to an environmental change, and how they contribute to ecosystem services. Building on analogous efforts by plant ecologists, we propose a trait-based framework that aims to predict the resistance and recovery of coral ecosystem services against both pulse and press disturbances. The framework involves identifying effect, resistance, and recovery traits across coral species and using these to ascertain how species might (1) contribute to a service, (2) resist disturbance, and (3) recover after the disturbance. By identifying trait functional overlaps and quantifying correlations among the trait types, the framework can yield a better understanding of the potential mechanistic links between community assembly, ecosystem dynamics, and ecosystem functioning. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to a virtual scenario, implemented via simulation, in which habitat provisioning is the focal ecosystem service, and cyclones and bleaching events are the disturbances of interest. This demonstration required us to assemble an extensive dataset of relevant traits-a process that revealed key gaps in the coral trait database and in our understanding of coral functional ecology. The framework can provide predictive power for the resilience of ecosystem services and can also help identify crucial knowledge gaps, research objectives, and strategies for applying a trait-based approach to advancing coral reef science and conservation."

Water quality planning aims to mitigate pollutant run-off through land management, including riparian and wetland restoration, but no tools exist to assess trade-offs in land use change across the catchment-to-reef continuum. We adapted the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment framework in the GBR's Tully-Murray catchment to identify trade-offs between linked ecosystem services and stakeholders. Applying four land use scenarios we assessed outcomes for the ecosystem service of water quality regulation, and trade-offs with six floodplain services and four GBR services. Based on statistical correlations between ecosystem services' status under the scenarios, we identified trade-offs and thresholds between services and associated stakeholders. The most direct trade-off in floodplain services (and primary stakeholders) was food and fibre production (farmers) versus water quality regulation (community, GBR tourists, tour operators and fishermen). There were synergies between water quality regulation (community, GBR tourists, tour operators and fishermen) and floodplain recreational and commercial fisheries (fishermen). Scale mis-matches between water quality management structures and ecosystem service flows were also evident.

The objective of this paper was to develop an integrated process-based modeling method to simulate changes in multiple ecosystem services in 2000-2009 at pixel and regional scales in the Zhangye oasis of northwestern China. Six ecosystem service indicators were selected and quantified using process-based models, including net primary production (NPP), grain production, net oxygen production (NOP), carbon sequestration (CS), water conservation, and soil conservation. Analytical results were as follows: (1) At the oasis scale, NPP, NOP, CS, water conservation, and soil conservation decreased from 2000 to 2009, whereas grain production increased. (2) At the pixel scale, the spatial changes in NPP were similar to those in NOP and CS, but changes in grain production showed the opposite pattern. Water conservation and soil conservation showed somewhat unintuitive spatial patterns. (3) The impact of land-use forms on ecosystem services showed that grazing and township construction both had negative impacts on all services, but that nature conservation and wetland development had positive impacts on all services. This research showed that the integrated modeling can be proposed as an environmental decision-making tool in similar case studies."

This study outlines a methodology for using that type of monitoring data to run a rangeland hydrology and erosion model in order to estimate the relative soil erosion rates across ecosystems located in the American Southwest. The model was run on 134 NRI rangeland field locations with data collected between 2003 and 2006 in Major Land Resource Area 41, the Southeastern Arizona Basin and Range, which is a diverse ecological area of 40,765 km(2) (15, 739 mi(2)) in the transition zone between the Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts. Results of the study showed that the data collected was adequate to run the model and effectively assess the influence of foliar cover, ground cover, plant life forms, soils, and topography on current soil erosion rates. Results suggested that the model could be further improved with additional measured experimental data on infiltration, runoff, and soil erosion within key ecological sites in order to better quantify model parameters to reflect ecosystem changes and risk of crossing interdependent biotic and abiotic thresholds."

The investigation of consistent associations between ecological parameters, called bundles, and of their links to landscape composition and structure is essential to inform management and policy, yet it is still in its infancy. We mapped over the French Alps an unprecedented array of 18 ecological parameters (16 ES and two biodiversity parameters) and explored their co-occurrence patterns underpinning the supply of multiple ecosystem services in landscapes. We followed a three-step analytical framework to i) detect the ES and biodiversity associations relevant at regional scale, ii) identify the clusters supplying consistent bundles of ES at subregional scale and iii) explore the links between landscape heterogeneity and ecological parameter associations at landscape scale. We used successive correlation coefficients, overlap values and self-organizing maps to characterize ecological bundles specific to given land cover types and geographical areas of varying biophysical characteristics and human uses at nested scales from regional to local. The joint analysis of land cover richness and ES gamma diversity demonstrated that local landscape heterogeneity alone did not imply compatibility across multiple ecosystem services, as some homogeneous landscape could supply multiple ecosystem services.Synthesis and applications. Bundles of ecosystem services and biodiversity parameters are shaped by the joint effects of biophysical characteristics and of human history. Due to spatial congruence and to underlying functional interdependencies, ecological parameters should be managed as bundles even when management targets specific objectives. Moreover, depending on the abiotic context, the supply of multiple ecosystem services can arise either from deliberate management in homogeneous landscapes or from spatial heterogeneity.

We have presented a simplified approach to resilience assessment that reviews the scientific, historical, and social literature to rate the resilience of an SES with respect to nine resilience properties: ecological variability, diversity, modularity, acknowledgement of slow variables, tight feedbacks, social capital, innovation, overlap in governance, and ecosystem services. We evaluated the effects of two large-scale projects, the construction of a major dam and the implementation of an ecosystem recovery program, on the resilience of the central Platte River SES (Nebraska, United States). We used this case study to identify the strengths and weaknesses of applying a simplified approach to resilience assessment. Although social resilience has increased steadily since the predam period for the central Platte River SES, ecological resilience was greatly reduced in the postdam period as compared to the predam and ecosystem recovery program time periods."

In theory, ecosystem management will utilize the best available science to sustain social-ecological systems in the landscape by maximizing multiple ecosystem services expected from the stake-holders' of those systems. Llancahue is a watershed (1,270 ha) that provides fresh water to the city of Valdivia (130,000 inhabitants) and protects[ 700 ha of old-growth forest within a severely disturbed landscape in the lowlands of south-central Chile. The native vegetation of this landscape is the threatened Valdivian Temperate Rainforests. Management of the watershed by the Universidad Austral de Chile needs to both provide timber and work to the neighboring campesinos (small poor rural land owners) who were illegally logging the forest and improve the conservation of the old-growth forests and the quantity and quality of water provided by the watershed. This paper demonstrates how adaptive management has utilized a multi-step process to improve management of the watershed. This process has included (1) understanding stakeholders' views towards the project, (2) developing an ecosystem management plan for the watershed that balanced multiple societal demands and ecosystem functions from the watershed, and (3) monitoring the Llancahue forest and streams to ensure activities provided desired results. This paper reports results after 4 years of implementation and provides perspectives on the ecosystem management approach."

In this study, we investigated the diversity and patterns of wild landscapes in relation to ecological factors, human disturbances and land protection regime in the Mo river basin (Central Togo). First, we used geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing techniques to quantify and spatially explicit the major land cover types occurring in the area. We performed a supervised classification of Landsat 8 image from 2014. Next, we used vegetation ordination and classification methods to detect vegetation group types and their similarity level from forest inventory data collected at 75 sites. Data from soil samples at the 75 sites and DEM-based topographical indices were used as biophysical variables to analyze factors of current landscape structure. Both satellite image classification and the outputs from ordination methods indicated that three major vegetation types (forestlands, woodlands and savannahs/shrubs) occurred in protected (PA) and unprotected (UPA) areas. Image classification showed that savannahs/shrubs are the most widespread vegetation types (54.4%) while forestlands and woodlands cover 10.4% and 26.4% of the total area, respectively. UPA showed high rates of human disturbances that shaped the occurrence of a fourth vegetation type made up mainly by degraded savannahs and woodlands. Along the land protection gradient, the landscapes are driven by soil nutrients and moisture, in combination with the influence of topography and human disturbances. In both PA and UPA, and along protection gradient, majority of features exhibited significant differences among plant communities. The spatial analyses combined with the field data providing information on vegetation cover, species richness, and human footprint indices suggested that some areas outside protection still exhibit high potentials for land conservation. In multifunctional landscapes of Mo basin, conservation strategies could also be encouraged in the wild landscapes of community common lands to promote both biodiversity conservation and sustainable provision of ecosystem services.

Where mechanisms to pay for ES exist, they may serve as incentives to embark on habitat restoration projects. We evaluated the potential of newly established carbon markets in the United States to incentivize afforestation along riparian corridors, by comparing the income earnable by carbon offset credits with the costs of planting, maintaining, and registering such a restoration project in California. We used a 20-year chronosequence of riparian forest sites along the Sacramento River as our model project. We found that carbon credits can repay more than 100% of costs after two decades of regrowth, if sufficient effort is put into sampling intensity in the first post-restoration decade. However, carbon credits alone are unlikely to entice landowners currently engaged in agricultural activities to switch from farming crops to farming habitat."

Here, we investigated the influence of four soil formation factors: climate, biota, parent materials, and topography. Along the northern Gulf of Mexico, we collected wetland plant and soil data across elevation and zonation gradients within 10 estuaries that span broad temperature and precipitation gradients. Our results highlight the importance of climate-plant controls and indicate that the influence of elevation is scale and location dependent. Coastal wetland plants are sensitive to climate change; small changes in temperature or precipitation can transform coastal wetland plant communities. Across the region, SOM was greatest in mangrove forests and in salt marshes dominated by graminoid plants. SOM was lower in salt flats that lacked vascular plants and in salt marshes dominated by succulent plants. We quantified strong relationships between precipitation, salinity, plant productivity, and SOM. Low precipitation leads to high salinity, which limits plant productivity and appears to constrain SOM accumulation. Our analyses use data from the Gulf of Mexico, but our results can be related to coastal wetlands across the globe and provide a foundation for predicting the ecological effects of future reductions in precipitation and freshwater availability. Coastal wetlands provide many ecosystem services that are SOM dependent and highly vulnerable to climate change.

Replicated sites at two locations with contrasting geomorphic conditions were selected, Tiwoho and Tanakeke on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia. These locations are representative of high (Tiwoho, deep muds and silty substrates) and low (Tanakeke, shallow, coralline sands) productivity mangrove ecosystems. They share a similar management history of clearing and conversion for aquaculture before restorative activities were undertaken using the practice of Ecological Mangrove Rehabilitation (EMR). Species diversity and mean biomass carbon storage gains after 10 yr of regrowth from the high productivity sites of Tiwoho (49.2 +/- 9.1 Mg C center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1)) are already almost of one-third of mean biomass stocks exhibited by mature forests (167.8 +/- 30.3 Mg C center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1)). Tiwoho's EMR sites, on average, will have offset all biomass C that was initially lost through conversion within the next 11 yr, a finding in marked contrast to the minimal carbon gains observed on the low productivity, low diversity, coral atoll EMR sites of Tanakeke (1.1 +/- 0.4 Mg C center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1)).

However, high dependence of humans on these systems is leading to significant transformation of mangrove wetlands and reduction in their ecosystem services including fisheries. The objectives of this study were to estimate the biomass of two mangrove wetlands in Ghana within urban and rural contexts and determine the fish fauna assemblages as part of baseline setting. The study used the structural parameters of mangrove species and allometry to estimate the biomass of both forest systems. Fish community structure were determined based on ecological surveys. The findings show that the standing biomass of the mangrove forests were significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the rural wetland (394.49 t/ha) compared to the urban wetland (126.29 t/ha).

Despite the general recognition that ecosystems provide many services and benefits to humans, little effort has been made to address how increasing anthropogenic eutrophication affects those services. We conducted a field experiment to determine the effect of nutrient enrichment on five ecological services provided by a model coastal system, a shallow seagrass community near Mobile Bay, Alabama (USA): (1) the provision of shelter for fauna; (2) the quality of food provided to first-order consumers; (3) quantity of food provision to first-order consumers and O-2/CO2 exchange; (4) producer carbon and nitrogen storage, and (5) water clarity. The results showed a severe negative impact on seagrass density and biomass, which greatly reduced the structural complexity of the community and provision of shelter to fauna. Water clarity and the standing stock of producer carbon were reduced in the fertilized area in comparison with the control area. In contrast, nutrient addition did not affect in any consistent way the total quantity of food available for first-order consumers, the net exchange of O-2/CO(2)d, or the standing stock of producer nitrogen in the community. The nutritional quality of the food available for first-order consumers increased with fertilization. These results show that the impacts of nutrient enrichment on the services provided by natural systems may be disparate, ranging from negative to positive. These findings suggest that management policies for anthropogenic eutrophication will depend on the specific ecosystem service targeted. In the case of shallow seagrass beds, the loss of biogenic habitat and drastic impacts on commercially important fauna may be sufficiently alarming to warrant rigorous control of coastal eutrophication."

We developed a data-driven approach to functional group definition and applied it to a case study of 16 species of seed -dispersing Afrotropical waterfowl for which we created seed dispersal functional groups using both a priori categories, as typically done in previous studies, and a hierarchical clustering approach. Relevant functional differences and similarities occur among the waterfowl, particularly in the types of plant family dispersed. We found evidence for at least five functional groups of seed disperser. The different groupings have important implications for both wetland and terrestrial plant dispersal. Our analysis suggests that even for a relatively data-scarce study system, using a data-driven approach to generate functional groups offers a feasible and ecologically rigorous approach and is a useful alternative to simple a priori classification schemes. Our approach is capable of capturing variation across several functional traits and suggests that existing datasets may be useful in exploring variation in biodiversity ecosystem function relationships. Since functional classification schemes may affect our conclusions about biodiversity, ecosystem function and ecosystem service provision, considerable care should be given to ensuring that functional groups are not defined in such a way as to mask important ecological differences among supposedly similar species."

Nutrient loading often first affects the primary productivity of aquatic systems through shifts in phytoplankton communities. However, ecologically important changes in phytoplankton are often not relatable to the general public-whose behavior would need to change to alter patterns of nutrient loading. Therefore, we use the STressor-Ecological Production function-final ecosystem Services Framework to develop 154 chains that link changes in biological indicators of aquatic eutrophication (a shift in phytoplankton community) to final ecosystem services that people use or appreciate. We identify 13 ecological production functions (EPF) within three different ecosystems (alpine lakes, lakes, and estuaries) that connect changes in phytoplankton and algae to ecological endpoints that the general public and policy makers can appreciate. Using the Final Ecosystem Goods and Services Classification System, we identify 18 classes of human beneficiaries that potentially will be impacted by a change in one of these endpoints. We further assign strength-of-science scores to each link within the EPFs for the 154 chains according to how well each link is supported by current peer-reviewed literature. By identifying many pathways through which excess N loading in U. S. surface waters can affect ecosystems and ultimately the beneficiaries of ecosystem services, this work intends to draw attention to gaps in empirical ecological literature that constrain understanding of the magnitude of effects that excess N loading can have on human well-being. Results highlight the importance of intersections between the natural and social sciences when managers and policy makers evaluate impacts from ecological stressors.

The rapid expansion of oil palm in forested tropical landscapes is of particular concern given their high biodiversity. Identifying management approaches that maintain native species and associated ecological processes within oil palm plantations is therefore a priority. Riparian reserves are strips of forest retained alongside rivers in cultivated areas, primarily for their positive hydrological impact. However, they can also support a range of forest-dependent species or ecosystem services. We surveyed communities of dung beetles and measured dung removal activity in an oil palm-dominated landscape in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. The species richness, diversity, and functional group richness of dung beetles in riparian reserves were significantly higher than in oil palm, but lower than in adjacent logged forests. The community composition of the riparian reserves was more similar to logged forest than oil palm. Despite the pronounced differences in biodiversity, we did not find significant differences in dung removal rates among land uses. We also found no evidence that riparian reserves enhance dung removal rates within surrounding oil palm. These results contrast previous studies showing positive relationships between dung beetle species richness and dung removal in tropical forests. We found weak but significant positive relationships between riparian reserve width and dung beetle diversity, and between reserve vegetation complexity and dung beetle abundance, suggesting that these features may increase the conservation value of riparian reserves. Synthesis and applications: The similarity between riparian reserves and logged forest demonstrates that retaining riparian reserves increases biodiversity within oil palm landscapes. However, the lack of correlation between dung beetle community characteristics and dung removal highlights the need for further research into spatial variation in biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships and how the results of such studies are affected by methodological choices."

We assessed the impact of lake trout on a key piscivore, the river otter (Lontra canadensis) in two lakes in Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone Lake continues to support a native cutthroat trout population, although the recent introduction of lake trout has dramatically impacted the cutthroat trout population. Nearby Lewis Lake has an entirely introduced fish fauna of lake trout, brown trout (Salmo trutta), and Utah chub (Gilia atraria) but lacks cutthroat trout. Analysis of otter scat from Yellowstone Lake implicated trout (lake or cutthroat trout) as a major prey item (57% of scat), whereas stable isotopes identified longnose suckers (Catostomus catostomus) as the primary prey there (58% of diet). By contrast, scat from Lewis Lake implicated minnows, presumably Utah chub, as the primary prey for otters occupying that lake (86%), while stable isotopes implicated brown trout (64%) over both lake trout and Utah chub (36% combined). Our data establish the importance of alternative prey to otters and suggest that lake trout-induced reductions in cutthroat trout may not be catastrophic for otter populations here. These data do not necessarily exonerate lake trout, as their impact on other species, most notably grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and piscivorous birds, has been documented to be substantial, and further data on the nutritional value of alternate prey are required to confirm or refute a working hypothesis that otter populations will continue to thrive in the face of the lake trout invasion.

Their status and role in tropical regions are poorly understood, resulting in a nearly complete lack of effort toward their conservation. Understanding mussel functions in developing countries is particularly important because costly interventions to restore habitat functionality are often infeasible. We investigated the role of mussels in the nearshore zone of Dhanmondi Lake, a narrow, polluted lake in central Dhaka, Bangladesh, during the dry season. Sampling at 50 sites 1 to 3 m from the shore revealed dense mussel populations, averaging 218 individuals (ind)/m(2) from 2 species (Lamellidens marginalis and Parreysia caerulea). Based on laboratory filtration rates and in-situ size-frequency distribution, we calculated that mussels filter the equivalent of the volume of the lake margins in 21 h. This filtration capacity appears to explain the lake's high water clarity (>2 m visibility during the dry season), despite copious nutrient availability for algal growth. Although it is heavily polluted, the near shore zone of the lake has a diverse macroinvertebrate fauna, featuring up to 16 invertebrate families/0.25 m(2). Strong positive correlations among mussel density, macroinvertebrate richness, and diversity were revealed through 2-min kick-samples, and indicate that mussels act as microhabitat engineers that promote localized biodiversity. Loss of mussel communities could result in further loss of ecosystem services, which would be costly to replace through other means. Moreover, our data suggest that mussel abundance may be used to identify sites of high macroinvertebrate biodiversity in tropical freshwaters and, thus, help to focus management efforts in the most cost-effective way."

This paper advances a framework to identify, map and assess ES bundles from a supply-demand approach to informlandscape planning and management. The framework is applied to the Barcelona metropolitan region, Spain, covering five ES and using eleven spatial indicators. Each indicator was quantified and mapped at the municipal level (n = 164) combining different proxy-and process-based models. Our results show significant associations among ES, both at the supply and demand sides. Further, we identified five distinct ES supply-demand bundle types and characterized them based on their specific ES relationships and their main underlying social-ecological conditions. From our findings, we contend that land sharing strategies should be prioritized in urban and agricultural areas to increase landscape multifunctionality while assuring the conservation of large periurban forest areas that are critical for delivering a wide range of local ES highly demanded by the urban population.

Six years following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the largest in US history, the complexity of ecological injuries in this system is just now being elucidated. Here, we describe a novel pathway of injury from oil spills by documenting how the loss of oysters near marsh edge as a direct result of shoreline oiling and clean-up activities can double rates of coastal erosion. As part of the natural resource damage assessment, we examined the impact of shoreline oiling on eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica near the marsh edge at 187 sites in Louisiana and Mississippi Sound in 2013. For marshes that experienced heavy oiling, oyster habitat was 77% less abundant than in areas where no oil was observed. Areas near marshes characterized by more moderate levels of oiling had 33% less oyster habitat than areas where no oil was observed. Similarly, the number of sites without any oyster habitat was higher in heavily and persistently oiled areas compared to areas where no oil was observed (56 vs. 24%). The consequences of this loss are substantial and include loss of essential fish habitat, reduced nutrient cycling, and decreased erosion buffering. For a subset of the sites where erosion rate was also measured between 2010 and 2013 (n = 79), shoreline loss was more than twice as high (2.1 vs. 0.9 m yr(-1)) in areas lacking oyster cover.

We estimated, as of 2010, that this restoration removes 170 ton of nitrogen per year via denitrificiation and sequesters carbon at a rate of 630 tons carbon per year in the sediment. Further, we estimated that natural recovery would take more than 100 years to reach the areal coverage achieved by restoration using seeds in just 10 years. Restoration enhanced this recovery, and the earlier establishment of plants results in a net gain of at least 4,100 ton of nitrogen removed from the system via denitrification and 15,000 ton of carbon sequestered in the sediment.

This study applied systems ecology theory and ecological energetic analysis to value the worth of natural environment and ecosystem services to a socioeconomic system. We begin with a general discussion of pen-urban areas and their ecosystem services. An emergy approach is applied to establish a framework for evaluating the ecosystem services by identifying systemic roles of each system components. The two-part framework includes: (1) an emergy evaluation of energetic flows of ecosystem services; and (2) an impact matrix to analyze systemic roles of services in the analyzed system. On the basis of the proposed valuation framework and land cover types in the greater Taipei area, this study analyzed ten ecosystems to determine how they interact, via energy flows, to contribute services to human society. By converting all stocks and flows into common emergy units, an impact matrix is constructed to analyze the systemic role of ecosystem components by classifying their status of being active, reactive, critical or indifferent. The analytical results indicate that the soil component of forest ecosystems, upstream rivers and agricultural productivity play critical role of ecosystem services in the study region.

Changed hydrology, poor stormwater quality, and the modification of water bodies associated with urban development brings challenges for maintaining ecosystem services provision in an urban aquatic SES. Water sensitive urban design (WSUD) has emerged as a form of development that aims to better support the provision of ecosystem services. Resilience concepts provide a basis for discriminating between WSUD and conventional development approaches. Building on an existing decision support system, a new, preliminary method for assessing resilience based on the combination of the socio-technical capacity (STC) and natural capacity (NC) of urban aquatic SESs has been developed. The STC score reflects a multicriteria assessment of the characteristics of stormwater infrastructure and management. The NC score reflects an assessment of the state and trajectory of biophysical attributes of the system associated with the provision of ecosystem services. By modeling a series of future urban development scenarios in Auckland, New Zealand, the method has been shown to discriminate between scenario outcomes within constraints associated with the biophysical and built characteristics modeled. Results are consistent with key concepts of resilience theory: outcomes are grouped in regimes and exhibit hysteresis, with the ability of WSUD to improve the state of the system strongly influenced by the presence of legacy effects. The method provides a source of additional, valuable information that complements other indicators by providing a snapshot of the interaction of catchment management effort and outcomes and indicating the likely future state of the SES. Recognizing that the method is limited to providing a relative assessment of resilience and adopts certain simplistic assumptions, further research aims to investigate assessment methods that consider other, fundamental biophysical and social properties of urban aquatic SESs."

This study evaluates the success of salt marsh restoration using a Regulated Tidal Exchange (RTE) system in SW England, i.e., a self-regulating tidal gate (SRT), in controlling the partial saline inundation of a 14-ha area of former salt marsh reclaimed for agriculture in 1760. A combination of (a) direct hydrodynamic monitoring of water and sediment flux and (b) repeat surveys to evaluate morphological and ecological (plants and foraminifera) changes over a 5-year period, was implemented immediately following SRT commissioning. Morphological changes were limited to the proximity of the SRT system due to limited sediment influx yielding sedimentation rates that were an order of magnitude below a nearby natural marsh. Ecological change to an ephemeral salt marsh community was only detected after 5 years of inundation cycles, with the delayed response attributed to (a) an initial limited tidal inundation due to conservative SRT settings, followed by (b) excessive inundation due to excessive rainfall and recurring SRT failure in an open position, and (c) a lack of sediment and propagule supply caused by (a) & (b) and the relatively narrow inlet pipe used in the SRT system. While the ecological response under optimum SRT settings was encouraging, the lack of perennial plants and limited foraminifera abundance demonstrated that the marsh was far from reaching natural status. We surmise that this is primarily due to inundation being more rapid than drainage leading to excessive submergence during a tidal cycle. Our study shows that the design of tidal inundation schemes requires a synergistic understanding of core ecological and geomorphological approaches to assess viability and success. We conclude that SRT can be a useful technique for intertidal habitat creation where there are significant site constraints (especially flood risk), but we need to be realistic in our expectations of what it can achieve in terms of delivering a perennial salt marsh community.

We used the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework to explore the relationships between the river ecosystem and the Biobio Basin's social system. We selected 65 basin and regional-scale indicators to analyse the existing trends and associations among the different DPSIR components. The trend analysis results showed major biodiversity loss and how the regulating services and non-material goods of the HWB component deteriorated, while cultural services, direct and indirect pressures and institutional responses increased. The relationships among the different DPSIR components revealed biodiversity loss to be positively associated with cultural services, the material goods of the HWB component and pressures.

To explore the floodplain functioning of a tropical monsoon river system the longitudinal and transverse floodwater hydrochemical characteristics were studied in the Songkhram river (Thailand) and its floodplains. Water samples were taken during the monsoon period from 61 locations in the river and on its floodplain. Analysis of floodwater hydrochemistry revealed a significant decreasing longitudinal trend for most dissolved solids, attributable to geological differences. We also observed a significant decreasing transverse trend from river to floodplain. Nutrient concentrations revealed lower dissolved nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium concentrations on the floodplain than in the river channel, which suggests the floodplain functions as a sink for nutrients and chemical species in the river floodwater. This sink function may be related to the presence of a belt of bamboo separating the river from the floodplain, which seems to acts as a sediment trap and nutrient filter, but this needs to be verified by additional dedicated research."

However, assessments of landscape potential for tourism tend to be very general. Therefore, this study proposes a method that takes into account both the complexity of landscape and the behavior of tourists. We introduce a new approach that encompasses both human and ecological aspects. The latter is broken down into biotic and abiotic elements, characterized by a variety of features. Tourism is assessed as a set of outdoor activities that are analyzed individually. Natural landscape potential is divided into intrinsic and service potential. Intrinsic potential describes the capacity of the landscape to be used for tourism purposes. Service potential adds tourists' willingness to undertake an activity. This is an important extension, as landscape service potential should be assessed as a function of the use tourists make of it; whether very often (e.g. walking) or very rarely (e.g. windsurfing). The Analytic Hierarchy Process was used to evaluate landscape properties, and a questionnaire evaluated tourist behavior. A case study was carried out in the Great Masurian Lakes (northeast Poland), which revealed substantial differences in the spatial diversity of intrinsic and service potentials. Furthermore, it showed that there are neither universally positive, nor negative landscape features as different activities have different, and sometimes opposing requirements. We believe that the proposed approach improves the accuracy of landscape potential assessment for tourism, thereby improving landscape planning and management."

The responses of metabolic rates to climate warming may be greatest in the tropics and at low elevations because mean temperatures are warmer there and metabolic rates respond exponentially to temperature (with exponents > 1). However, if warming rates are sufficiently fast in higher latitude/elevation lakes, metabolic rate responses to warming may still be greater there even though metabolic rates respond exponentially to temperature. Thus, a wide range of global patterns in the magnitude of metabolic rate responses to warming could emerge depending on global patterns of temperature and warming rates. Here we use the Boltzmann-Arrhenius equation, published estimates of activation energy, and time series of temperature from 271 lakes to estimate long-term (1970-2010) changes in 64 metabolic processes in lakes. The estimated responses of metabolic processes to warming were usually greatest in tropical/low-elevation lakes even though surface temperatures in higher latitude/elevation lakes are warming faster. However, when the thermal sensitivity of a metabolic process is especially weak, higher latitude/elevation lakes had larger responses to warming in parallel with warming rates. Our results show that the sensitivity of a given response to temperature (as described by its activation energy) provides a simple heuristic for predicting whether tropical/low-elevation lakes will have larger or smaller metabolic responses to warming than higher latitude/elevation lakes. Overall, we conclude that the direct metabolic consequences of lake warming are likely to be felt most strongly at low latitudes and low elevations where metabolism-linked ecosystem services may be most affected."

Here we compare the impacts of harvested perennial grass and annual crop fields on ecosystem functioning in KS, USA. Despite the lack of mineral fertilizer applications, the aboveground harvests of perennial fields yielded similar levels of N compared to those of conventional high-input wheat (Triticum aestivum) fields and at only 8% of the in-field energy costs. Their 75-yr cumulative N yield per ha was approximately 23% greater than that from the region's wheat fields. In terms of aboveground food webs, perennial fields harboured greater numbers and/or diversity of insect pollinators, herbivores and detritivores. Belowground, perennial grass fields maintained 43 Mg ha(-1) more soil carbon and 4 Mg ha(-1) more soil nitrogen than annual crop fields in the surface 1 m. Soil food webs in perennial fields, as indicated by nematode communities, exhibited greater food web complexity and stability than did those in annual crop fields.

Herbiciding and burning to control invasive plants have not been effective in part because neither strategy addresses the most common root cause of invasion, nutrient enrichment. Mechanical harvesting is an alternative approach that removes tissue-bound phosphorus and nitrogen and can increase wetland plant diversity and aquatic connectivity between wetland and lacustrine systems. In this study, we used data from three years of Great Lakes-wide wetland plant surveys, published literature, and bioenergy analyses to quantify the overall areal extent of GLCWs, the extent and biomass of the three most dominant invasive plants, the pools of nitrogen and phosphorus contained within their biomass, and the potential for harvesting this biomass to remediate nutrient runoff and produce renewable energy. Of the approximately 212,000 ha of GLCWs, three invasive plants (invasive cattail, common reed, and reed canary grass) dominated 76,825 ha (36%). The coastal wetlands of Lake Ontario exhibited the highest proportion of invasive dominance (57%) of any of the Great Lakes, primarily from cattail. A single growing season's biomass of these invasive plants across all GLCWs was estimated at 659,545 metric tons: 163,228 metric tons of reed canary grass, 270,474 metric tons of common reed, and 225,843 metric tons of invasive cattail, and estimated to contain 10,805 and 1144 metric tons of nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively. A one-time harvest and utilization for energy of this biomass would provide the gross equivalent of 1.8 million barrels of oil if combusted, or 0.9 million barrels of oil if converted to biogas in an anaerobic digester. We discuss the potential for mitigating non-point source nutrient pollution with invasive wetland plant removal, and other potential uses for the harvested biomass, including compost and direct application to agricultural soils. Finally, we describe the research and adaptive management program we have built around this concept, and point to current limitations to the implementation of large-scale invasive plant harvesting."

Yet, restoration activities do not always result in the return of desired biota. This study evaluated a restoration project in the Vindel River in northern Sweden in which practitioners further increased channel complexity of previously restored stream reaches by placing very large boulders (> 1 m), trees (> 8 m), and salmonid spawning gravel from adjacent upland areas into the channels. One reach restored with basic methods and another with enhanced methods were selected in each of ten different tributaries to the main channel. Geomorphic and hydraulic complexity was enhanced but the chemical composition of riparian soils and the communities of riparian plants and fish did not exhibit any clear responses to the enhanced restoration measures during the first 5 years compared to reaches restored with basic restoration methods. The variation in the collected data was among streams instead of between types of restored reaches. We conclude that restoration is a disturbance in itself, that immigration potential varies across landscapes, and that biotic recovery processes in boreal river systems are slow. We suggest that enhanced restoration has to apply a catchment-scale approach accounting for connectivity and availability of source populations, and that low-intensity monitoring has to be performed over several decades to evaluate restoration outcomes."

To better understand these linkages, we investigated shared trends and causal factors driving fish catch in a major Amazonian tributary before dam construction to derive relationships between catch and natural hydrologic dynamics that can be used to assess likely post-dam fisheries impacts. We applied a time series-based dimension reduction technique (dynamic factor analysis) to investigate dynamics in fish catch across 10 commercially important species using daily fish landings and hydrological data. We found a 4-trend dynamic factor model to best fit the observed data, with fitted trends exhibiting variation representative of seasonal and longer-term hydrologic variation. We next considered 11 candidate explanatory time series and found the best dynamic factor model used 4 explanatory variables: maximum water level, flooding duration, previous year's flow, and rate of change in flow; however, each species showed a unique response to this set of hydrological variables. Species-specific responses suggested that future dam operating rules need to closely mimic the natural hydrologic regime in order to maintain the biological dynamics of this and similarly diverse systems.

We found that live and dead biomass pools had mostly recovered to remnant forest levels within two decades of replanting, but soil carbon and nitrogen stocks, rates of CO2 efflux, N availability, and nutrient-use efficiency still differed significantly between restored and remnant forests.

This is a challenging task because different indicators of water quality and yield are expected to vary in their responsiveness to large versus local-scale heterogeneity in land use and land cover (LUC). Here we rely on water quality data collected between 1977 and 2000 from dozens of gauge stations in Puerto Rico together with precipitation data and land cover maps to (1) quantify impacts of spatial heterogeneity in LUC on several water quality indicators; (2) determine the spatial scale at which this heterogeneity influences water quality; and (3) examine how antecedent precipitation modulates these impacts. Our models explained 30-58% of observed variance in water quality metrics. Temporal variation in antecedent precipitation and changes in LUC between measurements periods rather than spatial variation in LUC accounted for the majority of variation in water quality. Urbanization and pasture development generally degraded water quality while agriculture and secondary forest re-growth had mixed impacts. The spatial scale over which LUC influenced water quality differed across indicators. Turbidity and dissolved oxygen (DO) responded to LUC in large-scale watersheds, in-stream nitrogen concentrations to LUC in riparian buffers of large watersheds, and fecal matter content and instream phosphorus concentration to LUC at the sub-watershed scale. Stream discharge modulated impacts of LUC on water quality for most of the metrics.

Here we integrate field sampling, insect marking, insecticide disruption, and molecular gut content analysis to explore the potential value of non-crop habitats to predators of brassica pests in temperate Australia. Twelve monthly surveys of 13 farms established that an exotic ladybird (Hippodamia variegata) and a native lacewing (Micromus tasmaniae) were numerically dominant predatory arthropod species in brassica crops and present in adjacent perennial pasture, bushland and riparian vegetation. We applied dye to non-crop vegetation on three sites and subsequently sampled predators from adjacent brassica crops. Relatively large proportions of H. variegata and M. tasmaniae were marked, especially close to the non-crop vegetation though also extending 100 m into the crop, indicating predator immigration into the crop. In a third study, predators were monitored in three brassica crops after the host farmers sprayed insecticide to control what they considered to be excessive pest densities. Within two days, H. variegata and M. tasmaniae adults were present in the crops and numbers increased significantly over 12 days showing rapid crop recolonisation. Finally, molecular gut analysis indicated large proportions of both predator species sampled from non-crop (non-brassica) vegetation contained DNA of brassica-specialist herbivores suggesting predator movement from crop to non-crop vegetation, possibly to access nectar. Findings demonstrate H. variegata and M. tasmaniae are likely to be important predators of brassica pests in the region and expand our understanding of the significance of non-crop vegetation for coccinellids and lacewings.

Using a biophysical model, we mapped six ES in the Manas River Basin, which is a typical MOD area. A questionnaire survey was employed to evaluate social demand for ES and human well-being in four different regional units (i.e., high mountain, low hills, oasis and desert) in our site. Spider diagrams were applied to identify the links among ES supply, social demand and human well-being. The results showed that a high supply of provisioning services occurred in the oasis, while a high supply of regulating services existed in the high mountain region. The ES social demand was not completely accordant with the biophysical supply in spatial distribution, and the factors from the supply side and demand side could both cause ES supply-demand mismatches. The total well-being level of all indicators was higher in the oasis and desert than in the upstream areas (i.e., the high mountain region and low hills region), but some indicators (e.g., water consumption) were the inverse. The supply-demand mismatches in provisioning services had a strong impact on human well-being, while the supply-demand mismatches in regulating services had a low impact on human well-being. This can be explained by the ES social demand questionnaire results, which showed that the level of social importance was higher for provisioning services than for regulating services at our site. In accordance with our results, we recommended several policies to promote ecological conservation and improve human well-being in the Manas River Basin, and these policies could also be applied in other MOD areas.

Each of these habitats can decrease the potential for eutrophication through increased nitrogen (N) removal via denitrification. However, the development of N cycling over time has not been studied in living shorelines. This research measured denitrification rates in a chronosequence of living shorelines spanning 0-20 years in age in Bogue Sound, NC. Analyses were conducted seasonally from summer 2014 to spring 2015 along an elevation transect through the salt marsh, oyster reef, and adjacent sandflat at all sites. Gas fluxe (N-2 and O-2) from sediment core incubations were measured with a membrane inlet mass spectrometer (MIMS) to assess denitrification and sediment oxygen demand. Fluxes of dissolved nutrients and the greenhouse gas N2O were measured. Sediment properties, inundation frequency, oyster filtration rates, and marsh grass stem density were also quantified. There was no significant difference in denitrification rates among habitats. N removal consistently increased from the 0- to 7-year-old sites. Denitrification efficiency was always greater than 50% and positive N2O fluxes were negligible. Our results suggest that living shorelines increase net N removal within a relatively short time period following construction, without introducing deleterious greenhouse gas emissions. This demonstrates that living shorelines can play an important role in estuarine N cycling and management."

The objective of this article is to emphasize the importance of different sources of knowledge in management alternatives for periurban watersheds. Specifically, this is done through (a) use of oral sources and archives to document the historic relationship between local residents and their natural resources, and (b) technical evaluation of the quantity and quality of water in the sub-basin through the time. We analyzed, through the 19 unstructured interviews, local residents' knowledge related to water quantity and quality. Additionally, we analyzed historical river flow data and water quality reports. The results show that the relationship between the local inhabitants and the river has been governed by public policies of both exploitation and conservation. For the last century, the river was used as the main source of electric power for local industry, the collapse of which, led to the decline of the importance of the river in the perception of the locals. Analysis of historical river flow data reveals a slight decrease in flow despite a trend of somewhat lower precipitation. This discrepancy may be due to hydraulic infrastructure construction and uncontrolled extraction. We conclude that the integration of two kinds of knowledge present a great opportunity to test a monitoring system that incorporates the environmental features that were more accurately described by the local residents: water quantity and forest land use."

Social-ecological vulnerability offers a valuable framework for identifying and understanding important social-ecological linkages, and the implications of dependencies and other feedback loops in the system. Unfortunately, its implementation at local scales has hitherto been limited due at least in part to the lack of operational tools for spatial representation of social-ecological vulnerability. We developed a method to map social-ecological vulnerability based on information on human-nature dependencies and ecosystem services at local scales. We applied our method to the small-scale fishery of Moorea, French Polynesia, by combining spatially explicit indicators of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of both the resource (i.e., vulnerability of reef fish assemblages to fishing) and resource users (i.e., vulnerability of fishing households to the loss of fishing opportunity). Our results revealed that both social and ecological vulnerabilities varied considerably through space and highlighted areas where sources of vulnerability were high for both social and ecological subsystems (i.e., social-ecological vulnerability hotspots) and thus of high priority for management intervention. Our approach can be used to inform decisions about where biodiversity conservation strategies are likely to be more effective and how social impacts from policy decisions can be minimized. It provides a new perspective on human-nature linkages that can help guide sustainability management at local scales; delivers insights distinct from those provided by emphasis on a single vulnerability component (e.g., exposure); and demonstrates the feasibility and value of operationalizing the social-ecological vulnerability framework for policy, planning, and participatory management decisions."

We identified ESBs based on IC-means clustering and redundancy analysis. The results showed that spatial patterns of each ES were quite heterogeneous at watershed level. Provisioning services were mainly distributed in watersheds with high proportion of cultivated land and waterbody. Remote forest areas provided high regulating services. Moreover, densely populated urban areas provide high cultural services. Five ESBs were detected ranging from 2941 to 16,249 km(2). According to the Pearson correlations and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), we detected the trade-offs between provisioning and cultural services, and between regulating and cultural services, and synergies happened within regulating services.

We revisited one of the earliest ecosystem experiments in North America: the 1963 de-vegetation of a forested catchment at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA. Potential benefits of the regulation of water flow, water quality, greenhouse gases, and forest growth were compared between experimental (WS 2) and reference (WS 6) watersheds over a 30-year period. Both watersheds exhibited similarly high capacity for flow regulation, in part because functional loads remained low (i.e., few major storm events) during the de-vegetation period. Drought mitigation capacity, or the maintenance of flows sufficient to satisfy municipal water consumption, was higher in WS 2 due to reduced evapotranspiration associated with loss of plant cover. We also assessed watershed capacity to regulate flows to satisfy different beneficiaries, including hypothetical flood averse and drought averse types. Capacity to regulate water quality was severely degraded during de-vegetation, as nitrate concentrations exceeded drinking water standards on 40% of measurement days. Once forest regeneration began, WS 2 rapidly recovered the capacity to provide safe drinking water, and subsequently mitigated the eutrophication potential of rainwater at a marginally higher level than WS 6. We estimated this additional pollution removal benefit would have to accrue for approximately 65-70 years to offset the net eutrophication cost incurred during forest removal. Overall, our results affirmed the critical role of forest vegetation in water regulation, but also indicated trade-offs associated with forest removal and recovery that partially depend on larger-scale exogenous changes in climate forcing and pollution inputs. We also provide a starting point for integrating long-term ecological research and modeling data into ecosystem services science."

While the role of space in regulating ecosystem functioning is well recognised in theory, it is rarely considered explicitly in empirical studies. Objectives We evaluated the role of spatial structuring within and between regions in explaining the functioning of 36 reference and human-impacted streams. Methods We gathered information on regional and local environmental variables, communities (taxonomy and traits), and used variance partitioning analysis to explain seven indicators of ecosystem functioning. Results Variation in functional indicators was explained not only by environmental variables and community composition, but also by geographic position, with sometimes high joint variation among the explanatory factors. This suggests spatial structuring in ecosystem functioning beyond that attributable to species sorting along environmental gradients. Spatial structuring at the within-region scale potentially arose from movements of species and materials among habitat patches. Spatial structuring at the between-region scale was more pervasive, occurring both in analyses of individual ecosystem processes and of the full functional matrix, and is likely to partly reflect phenotypic variation in the traits of functionally important species. Characterising communities by their traits rather than taxonomy did not increase the total variation explained, but did allow for a better discrimination of the role of space. Conclusions These results demonstrate the value of accounting for the role of spatial structuring to increase explanatory power in studies of ecosystem processes, and underpin more robust management of the ecosystem services supported by those processes."

Yet for most taxa, such patterns are rarely examined, especially at different levels of ecological organization (e.g., species-vs. community-level patterns). We compiled data on biomass, production, and P/B rates of freshwater fish communities and species across latitudes and contrast patterns observed at the community level with those observed for species. At the community level, and at two distinct spatial scales (global vs. continental-North American), negative or neutral relationships were apparent between biomass, production, and P/B with latitude; however, there was substantial scatter in these data. Yet at the species level in North America, production was often closely linked to latitude, but in the opposite direction: Many species showed improved production with latitude. Latitudinal increases in species-level production rates were strongest for cool-and cold-water species, and species rarely showed the opposite trend. Species-level increases in production with latitude strengthened when production rates were normalized by the thermal opportunity for production, suggesting potential adaptations of individuals and populations to shorter growing seasons (i.e., ""countergradient"" production) at high latitudes. At the global scale, there were apparent unimodal relationships between community fish production measures and species richness; however, these patterns became linearized or non-significant at the continental scale. Decreased interspecific competition at northern latitudes combined with genetic adaptations (e.g., countergradient growth) could explain a tendency for increased species production in northern populations, while total community production remains reduced. Latitude has contrasting effects on fish production at different spatial scales and levels of biological organization. Thus while freshwater fish communities are somewhat more productive and diverse at lower latitudes, species production in northern populations is often surprisingly high."

Delivery of particular services relies on specific ecological functions, and thus to varying degree on wetland ecological condition, commonly quantified as departure from minimally impacted reference sites. Condition assessments are widely adopted as regulatory indicators of ecosystem function, and for some services (e.g., habitat) links between condition and function are often direct. For others, however, links are more tenuous, and using condition alone to enumerate ecosystem value (e.g., for compensatory mitigation) may underestimate important services. Hydrologic function affects many services cited in support of wetland protection both directly (floodwater retention, microclimate regulation) and indirectly (biogeochemical cycling, pollutant removal). We investigated links between condition and hydrologic function to test the hypothesis, embedded in regulatory assessment of wetland value, that condition predicts function. Condition was assessed using rapid and intensive approaches, including Florida's official wetland assessment tool, in 11 isolated forested wetlands in north Florida (USA) spanning a land use intensity gradient. Hydrologic function was assessed using hydrologic regime (mean, variance, and rates of change of water depth), and measurements of groundwater exchange and evapotranspiration (ET). Despite a wide range in condition, no systematic variation in hydrologic regime was observed; indeed reference sites spanned the full range of variation. In contrast, ET was affected by land use, with higher rates in intensive (agriculture and urban) landscapes in response to higher leaf area. ET determines latent heat exchange, which regulates microclimate, a valuable service in urban heat islands. Higher ET also indicates higher productivity and thus carbon cycling. Groundwater exchange regularly reversed flow direction at all sites in response to rainfall. This buffering effect on regional aquifer levels, an underappreciated service of isolated wetlands, was provided regardless of condition. Intensive landscapes may benefit most from the hydrologic services that wetlands provide because that is where certain services (floodwater storage, microclimate regulation) are realized. While the portfolio of wetland services clearly changes with disturbance, our results support a revised approach to wetland valuation that recognizes the services that accrue from sustained or enhanced functions in these working wetlands."

Impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning, and subsequent delivery of ecosystem services, are too often overlooked. Here we use an ecosystem network approach to assess the recovery pathway and potential recovery debts of a coral reef ecosystem, following a pulse disturbance. We show that although species abundance and biomass indicators recovered in a decade after the perturbation, the ecosystem as a whole presented a recovery debt. The ecosystem structure lost complexity (became food chain like) and lost about 29% of its overall cycling efficiency and 9% of its transfer efficiency. Although the ecosystem trophic network in the fore reef may have maintained its general functioning, the ecosystem network in the lagoon, not directly exposed to the disturbance, presented a stronger recovery debt.

Five tree species with contrasted ecological characteristics were planted (Populus x canadensis, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Quercus macrocarpa, Quercus rubra and Pinus strobus), with black plastic (polyethylene) mulches as the vegetation management method, as well as a control with no vegetation management, all within a fenced herbaceous riparian buffer. Tree growth and survival were measured along with soil nutrient supply. Significant Species x Vegetation treatment interactions where observed for all growth variables (p < 0.001), but also for soil nitrate (NO3) supply (p < 0.01). All species benefited from the plastic mulch treatment, but varied greatly in their responses. After 5 years, mulched hybrid poplar produced 774 times more stem volume than red oak without mulch. Across all species/vegetation treatment combinations, a 13-fold variation in soil NO3 supply rate was observed during the 4th growing season. Compared to the other species, NO3 supply rate in hybrid poplar plots was 3987% lower in the plastic mulch treatment and 4862% lower in the control treatment. Significantly higher soil NO3 supply rates were observed beneath the mulches of non nitrophilous species (white pine and red oak). Red oak growth was negatively correlated with NO3 supply (R-2 = 0.57, p < 0.05) in the mulch treatment. Early-successional nitrophilous species (hybrid poplar and red ash) planted with the plastic mulch led to the lowest increase in soil NO3 and the greatest gains in buffer structural attributes (stem volume, diameter and height). Hybrid poplar growth was positively correlated with soil NO3 supply (R-2 = 0.86, p < 0.001) in the control treatment. Natural abandoned field/grassland invaders (white pine and bur oak) grew well without black plastic mulch, while the growth of non-mulched red oaks was marginal. In the control treatment, stem volume was a strong negative predictor (across all species) of soil NO3 supply (R-2 = 0.91, p < 0.05), indicating that under herbaceous vegetation competition larger trees have a greater ability to reduce soil NO3.

Irrespective of whether they were fenced or not, riparian margins had richer plant assemblages and supported more pollinators than grassland fields.

More bumblebees and butterflies were recorded in wide buffer strips (i.e. over 5 m wide) than in unfenced margins or narrow buffer strips (i.e. <= 3.5 m wide) and butterfly assemblages in wide buffer strips were richer and more diverse. There was a strong positive relationship between floral resources and the abundance, richness and diversity of bumblebee and butterfly assemblages. Pollinators only foraged on a small number of the flower species present and impacts of fencing and buffer strip width could not solely be attributed to the area and/or species richness of flowers. Fenced riparian buffer strips, particularly when over 5 m wide, have the potential to provide resources for insect pollinators in intensively grazed systems. Management to enhance floristic diversity (to provide a more continuous supply of pollen and nectar) and tussock forming grasses (to provide shelter for pollinators and nesting locations for bumblebees) could further increase their value to insect pollinators. In grassland systems, restricted grazing is easier to implement than mowing. It is, however, important that grazing management does not unduly interfere with other ecosystem services derived from riparian buffer strips (e.g. diffuse pollution mitigation). Widespread fencing of watercourses at the catchment level could result in the simplification of these inherently dynamic and complex habitats. Buffer strips should therefore be strategically placed to optimise benefits such as ecological connectivity and diffuse pollution mitigation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

We examined changes in land cover and riparian tree canopy near Sacramento, California, a Mediterranean climate region impacted by agriculture before urbanization. We used aerial imagery to quantify changes in land cover and the area, width, and density of riparian tree canopy between 1937 and 2014 for the 85-km(2) Arcade Creek watershed. While watershed land cover shifted almost entirely from pasture and crops to urban development, riparian forested area increased by 38 percent. The median width of riparian tree canopy more than doubled, and the density along smaller streams increased significantly (p < 0.0001). We used multiple data sources to examine potential drivers of these changes. Stream gage data and field observations indicated that the formerly intermittent Arcade Creek stream network receives spatially and temporally variable dry-season flow subsidies from urban runoff, but widespread channel incision may limit the impact of subsidies on riparian vegetation. Accordingly, sampling of riparian woody plants showed few hydrophilic species growing along these streams. Instead we found evidence of native oak regeneration and a high density of escaped horticultural species. The increase in riparian forest cover was thus likely due to changes in vegetation management and species composition from land use conversion, possibly augmented by increased dry-season water availability. The changes in canopy cover we quantified stand in contrast to the accepted pattern of riparian forest decline with urbanization, and are expected to affect ecosystem services."

However, a negative impact of this nutrient remediation may be that the ecozone also functions as a major emitter of nitrous oxide (N2O). We hypothesized that the high inorganic nitrogen, organic carbon, and soil water content in tropical riparian ecosystems enhances N2O production through rapid nitrification and denitrification processes. This study was therefore designed to quantify the variability in N2O emissions in such an ecosystem in northern Thailand with specific emphasis on (1) different land uses (comparing replicate leguminous reforestation areas with conventional maize agriculture with high rates of nitrogen fertilizer addition), and (2) temporal aspects (comparing wet and dry seasons). Our aim was to quantify N2O emissions and to identify the major drivers controlling these emissions. Using in situ closed chambers the annual average emissions of N2O from the leguminous reforestation area (3.3 kg N2O-N ha(-1) y(-1)) was significantly higher than agricultural areas with maize (2.2 kg N2O-N ha(-1) y(-1))). The seasonal variation results indicated that the rate of N2O flux in the wet season was higher than in the dry season. The variations of N2O emission rates were strongly correlated with water filled pore space (WFPS), denitrification, and microbial biomass C, but not with nitrification. This study indicates that when inorganic N and soil organic C are sufficient, WFPS plays an important role in controlling N2O emissions from denitrification. Comparatively, annual N2O emissions from the tropical riparian reforestation were similar to that reported for temperate riparian forests and other ecosystems. Although the annual N2O emissions from the maize agricultural area were comparable to other crops cultivated in riparian ecosystems, it was higher than the N2O fluxes from crops grown in non-riparian zones. We conclude that agricultural lands located in tropical riparian zones do not represent a major hotspot of N2O emissions and that this does not diminish the positive benefits they provide in relation to other aspects of ecosystem service provision.

Given the global marsh decline, there is a pressing need to understand the natural bottlenecks and thresholds to their establishment and long-term ecological maintenance. Seed presence in the right place and time is a prerequisite for pioneer establishment. We performed field surveys and manipulative seed-bank experiments on 2 mudflats with different levels of exposure in the Westerschelde, The Netherlands, to identify patterns of seed arrival and persistence and their role in determining seed bank abundance. Seed arrival decreased with distance from the seed-source area, i.e. the salt marsh, resulting in seeds being deposited on the mudflat close to the marsh edge. Once arrived, most of the surface seeds were washed away during subsequent tides, with retention of <20%. However, seed burial enhanced seed retention nonlinearly with increasing burial depth. Predation was not a major cause of seed loss. These results point to the importance of hydro dynamic and morphodynamic processes to both lateral seed dispersal and vertical seed burial on tidal flats and, therefore, suggest that saltmarsh establishment and expansion are closely linked to the physical dynamics of the entire estuarine system."

Understanding how different social and ecological factors shape the availability of ecosystem services is essential for fair and effective policy and management. In this paper, we evaluate how well alternative social-ecological models of human impact on ecosystems explain patterns of 16 ecosystem services (ES) across the 62 municipalities of the Norrstrom drainage basin in Sweden. We test four models of human impact on ecosystems, land use, ecological modernization, ecological footprint, and location theory, and test their ability to predict both individual ES and bundles of ES. We find that different models do best to predict different types of individual ES. Land use is the best model for predicting provisioning services, standing water quality, biodiversity appreciation, and cross-country skiing, while other models work better for the remaining services. However, this range of models is not able to predict some of the cultural ES. ES bundles are predicted worse than individual ES by these models, but provide a clear picture of variation in multiple ecosystem services based on limited information. Based on our results, we offer suggestions on how social-ecological modeling and assessments of ecosystems can be further developed."

A systems approach to maintaining natural resources focuses on how interactions and feedbacks among components of complex social-ecological systems generate social and ecological outcomes. In recreational fisheries, residential shoreline development and fish stocking are two widespread human behaviors that influence fisheries, yet emergent social-ecological outcomes from these potentially interacting behaviors remain under explored. We applied a social-ecological systems framework using a simulation model and empirical data to determine whether lakeshore development is likely to promote stocking through its adverse effects on coarse woody habitat and thereby also on survival of juvenile and adult fish. We demonstrate that high lakeshore development is likely to generate dependency of the ecosystem on the social system, in the form of stocking. Further, lakeshore development can interact with social-ecological processes to create deficits for state-level governments, which threatens the ability to fund further ecosystem subsidies. Our results highlight the value of a social-ecological framework for maintaining ecosystem services like recreational fisheries."

Pairwise ES interactions were quantified using a spatio-temporal statistical method. Spatio-temporal analyses of ES dynamics illustrated that the supply of the three ES increased over the past 14 years in northern Shaanxi, where land cover dramatically changed owing to the wide-range ecological restoration projects. Our results also revealed that ES interactions varied across locations due to landscape heterogeneity and climate difference. In the arid and semi-arid area, synergies among ES (e.g., SC vs. WY) tended to dominate in grassland, while in artificial lands ES were prone to show trade-offs. In the semi-humid area, pairwise ES (e.g., NPP vs. WY) in woodland tended to present synergies. The spatio-temporal variation of ES and their interactions resulted from coupling effect of human-induced climate and land-use change.

High spatial resolution aerial photography (2006) facilitated detection of floodplain features contributing to the production of ES. We also determined how river reach types are linked to production of ES. We found that ES capacity varied considerably with longitudinal position and reach type.

Agri-environment schemes attempt to counteract the loss of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services such as pollination and natural pest control in agro-ecosystems. However, only a few studies have evaluated whether these attempts are successful. 2. We studied the effects of managing meadows according to the prescriptions of ecological compensation areas (ECA), the most widely adopted agri-environment scheme in Switzerland, on both pollinator species richness and abundance, and the reproductive success of plants in nearby intensively managed meadows (IM). 3. We established arrays of four pots, each containing individuals of three insect-pollinated, non-autogamous 'phytometer' species (Raphanus sativus, Hypochaeris radicata and Campanula glomerata), in ECA and adjacent IM at increasing distances from the ECA at 13 sites. 4. Species richness and abundance of hoverflies, solitary bees and large-sized pollinators (mainly social bees and butterflies) were significantly higher in ECA than in adjacent IM. Species richness and abundance of small-sized pollinators in IM declined significantly with increasing distance from ECA, whereas large-sized pollinators were not significantly affected by distance. Plant species richness and flower abundance were the major drivers of pollinator species richness and abundance; the area of an ECA had no significant influence. 5. Individual plants of R. sativus and C. glomerata produced more and heavier seeds in ECA than in IM. Furthermore, the number of seeds of these two phytometer species was positively correlated with species richness and abundance of bees. No such effects were observed for individual plants of H. radicata. The number of fruits and seeds per plant of R. sativus in IM decreased with increasing distance from ECA. 6.

However, such a methodology has yet to be developed. Aiming to adapt systematic conservation planning procedures to include ES, we conducted a case study in eastern Canada focusing on ten ES for 16 wetland types. We first delimited the ES supply accessible for human use from the total biophysical supply and mapped demand for each ES. Secondly, we assembled conservation networks targeting the accessible supply and demand and compared them with networks targeting either ES biophysical supply or accessible supply. We found that targeting only ES supply resulted in selecting sites that are not in demand and may be up to three times less efficient in fulfilling the demands of beneficiaries for local flow ES. Thus, not considering demand in ES conservation assessment fails to position reserves where ES supply is likely to be most useful. Setting conservation targets for ES supply and demand could therefore help to achieve ES conservation objectives. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B. V."

Using an integrated human-biophysical model, we investigated the impacts of a species invasion and ecosystem restoration on SES equilibrium, defined here as a compromise in phosphorus management among opposing stakeholders, in western Lake Erie. Our integrated model is composed of a calibrated ecological submodel representing Sandusky Bay, and a phosphorus management submodel that reflects the societal benefits and costs of phosphorus regulation. These two submodels together form a dynamic feedback loop that includes freshwater ecology, ecosystem services, and phosphorus management. We found that the invasion of dreissenid mussels decreased ecosystem resistance to eutrophication, necessitating increased phosphorus management to preserve ecosystem services and thus creating the potential for a shift in social-ecological equilibrium. Additionally, our results suggest that net benefits in the region following the invasion of dreissenids may never again reach the pre-invasion level if on-site phosphorus control is the sole management lever. Further demonstrating transient system stability, large-scale wetland restoration shifted points of management compromise to states characterized by less on-site phosphorus management and higher environmental quality, resulting in a significant increase in net benefits in the region. We conclude that lacustrine SESs are open and dynamic, and we recommend that future models of these systems emphasize site-specific perturbation over equilibrium, thereby aiding the development of management plans for building system resistance to undesirable change that are both flexible and sustainable in an unknowable future."
2020-05-27,FALSE,R_240fccSKiMVrvXc,LD,"Uncovering the spatial dynamics of wild rice lakes, harvesters and management across Great Lakes landscapes for shared regional conservation",Q4,"Terrestrial,Freshwater",Ecosystem,Keep,Drewes,2012,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"Sustainable conservation and management of valued resources and ecosystem services relies on understanding the dynamics of the socio-ecological system. In the case of wild rice, a cherished food resource of Northern Great Lakes landscapes, the dynamics involve (a) a changing distribution of wild rice lakes, (b) changing harvester population and demographics, and (c) different management overlays. Together these factors influence harvester choices and opportunities and create unexpected spatial dynamics between people and the lakes they harvest. In this paper we examine first, the regional distribution and characteristics of wild rice lakes through compilation of multi-agency data, geospatial analysis, license sales and harvest surveys. Second, we identify patterns of harvest in the region through six case study lakes and examine the decision-making models used to open lakes for harvest. Gathered together these various forms of knowledge and collected data sets inform our understanding of the social ecological systems involving wild rice (Zizania palustris). Watersheds with wild rice have declined by 32% since the early 1900s, and are now primarily limited to northern Minnesota and Wisconsin. Across case studies wild rice harvesters tend to gather wild rice close to where they live or learned to harvest and 50% have more than 20 years experience. Some wild rice lakes draw harvesters from greater distances and in higher numbers. Models for managing the harvest of wild rice range from 'gather when ripe' by state entities to a more hands-on posting by reservation committees specifying hours and days of harvest on a lake by lake basis. The social ecological system around wild rice is a complex mosaic of multiple management jurisdictions, culturally diverse people, and an ecological system that is not well understood and potentially declining in extent. Defining the context of harvest within the spatially connected landscape and across multiple management systems is a first step in developing a shared framework of governance for the sustainability of wild rice landscapes.

We measured plant productivity, plant nutrient stoichiometry, and concentrations of N, P, and K in shoots and roots of Phragmites australis and Rumex maritimus and monitored how the clay-rich sediment from lake Markermeer changed into a wetland soil. Plants grown on Markermeer sediments tend to be N limited when periodically inundated and P limited when not inundated at all. The P availability was determined by the hydrological regime, while the N availability was determined by both the hydrological regime and the sediment type. Ecosystem development on created wetlands can be manipulated by adequate management of the hydrological regime, as plant species respond differently to changes in nutrient availability. This should be considered in eco-engineering projects where plants are used as ecological engineers to fasten ecosystem development on wetlands that are to be created from clay-rich material."

They improve water quality by retaining nutrients and sediment from through-flowing water, sequester carbon and attenuate flood peaks at high discharge. At the same time, they have been shown to enhance biodiversity at the landscape as well as regional scale. However, there is concern about loss of biodiversity and enhanced greenhouse gas emissions where wetlands have become overloaded with nutrient-rich surface water or groundwater. This paper discusses conditions for the best performance of riparian zones and other small wetlands in agricultural landscapes in terms of nutrient and greenhouse gas retention and biodiversity. High nitrous oxide emissions have been identified in riparian zones used for N removal and could be a concern which would diminish their overall environmental benefit. However, it has been shown in riparian zones in the Rhine and Scheldt catchment that nitrous oxide emissions mainly occur when soil pH values are lower than 5. Such conditions occur mostly in stream headwater areas only where sandy sediments have a low buffering capacity, whereas higher-order streams and their riparian zones often have fine silty clay or loam sediments with higher pH values, supporting effective denitrification with low nitrous oxide emission. The question whether the nutrient attenuation service comes at the expense of biodiversity losses should be answered differently for existing, (semi-)natural wetlands and for new wetlands created in the agricultural landscape. Existing wetlands are quite vulnerable for nutrient loading, depending on their natural nutrient richness. Oligotrophic and mesotrophic wetlands such as bogs and fens are negatively affected by nutrient loadings > 4 g N m(-2) y(-1) and 0.5 g P m(-2) y(-1), which lead to loss of diversity and characteristic species. Wetlands in riparian zones are naturally more nutrient-rich and can tolerate much higher nutrient loadings without consequences for ecosystem health and diversity, their loading limits are 50 g N m(-2) y(-1) and 4 g P m(-2) y(-1). For nitrogen the relatively high limit is explained by significant denitrification activities in wetlands, transforming nitrate to mostly inert elemental nitrogen gas. There are also indications that only one of the major nutrients needs to be in short supply (i.e. below the limits indicated) in order to avoid major eutrophication problems. In agricultural areas where large numbers of wetlands have been created for N removal and biodiversity enhancement, the experience of this 'dual purpose' are generally positive, particularly in landscapes where not much of the original wetland resource remains.

Managing ecosystems without prior knowledge: pathological outcomes of lake liming,Angeler,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,2017,SDJ/GV,TRUE,final,,0,"SDJ: The paper mentions particular fish that are important to humans (fisheries) but does not delve into how the community structure affects those ESPs. So Q14 not relevant; GV: Talked about services that are vital in freshwater lakes, but focused on community structure of groups. Fisheries would depend fairly clearly on fish community structure, so it is still included. No services truly measured.",FALSE,,"SDJ: Q12. The study included lakes that were naturally acidified and lakes that were acidified due to human activity. It also included lakes that were limed by humans and ones that were not. So water quality was determined by natural and human causes. They were particularly interested in the human-caused liming. The human driver relationship was mixed because adding lime to lakes that were naturally acidified seemed to cause negative changes in community structure. Adding lime to lakes that were acidified due to human use probably had neutral to beneficial impacts from a management standpoint (water quality). For food and feed, the fisheries potential is responding to the community structure/water quality/human liming. They estimate fisheries potential from occurrence of valuable fish species. Q13  Kremen topic 3 is relevant because the paper does include - how community structure is different in naturally acidified lakes compared to unnaturally acidified lakes, but they do not delve into those details or discuss them at all.; GV: No measurement of services/function except community structure of certain groups including fish, so fisheries was the closest link that they mentioned.","On the fence, but it seems like water quality metrics and indicator species for angling could be considered as measured ES/EF metrics affected by lake management decisions",

The fate of a major ecosystem service may then hinge disproportion- ately on the fate of individual, large-sized species—a finding with profound consequences for conservation priorities. Overall, we note that our general approach of estimating functional contributions of decomposer taxa as differences in mass among dung pats to which they had vs. lacked access relies on the explicit assumption that relevant taxa were present across sites. For pat- dwelling dung beetles in the genus Aphodius, this assumption was verified through direct sampling of five bait pats (see above and Appendix B).

The way Q12 is structured doesn't seem well suited to capture studies like this one that provide wall-to-wall maps of ES's/resilience/vulnerability. Because it's a spatial study, it inherently addresses scale, but it's also tricky to answer Q9 for this (e.g. there are no ""plots""). Ecological vulnerability and social vulnerability are not correlated in the same way consistently across space. The authors use indices for all three response variables of interest (socio-ecological vulnerability, ecol. vulnerability, and social vulnerability) with multiple factors underlying those indices. Ecological resilience index is based on a normalized ""intrinsic vulnerability to fishing index"" [from another model] and fish assemblage data; socio indices based on 11 indicator that they lumped into 5 components (spatial mobility, materials assets, occupational mobility, attachment, and education). All response indices are on a 0 to 1 (low to high) scale.

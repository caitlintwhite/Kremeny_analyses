Of the environmen- tal factors measured, pH is definitely the one which gives the best explanation of these differences (Fig. 2). At all sites where nitrous oxide emissions occurred, pH values were low, whereas emissions were negligible or even negative where pH was around 7.; TK: Barely a data paper but did include one really small study that has barely any connection to ES. Not sure it should have made it through, but it is tough. Weird paper.",,"CTW skimmed paper, thresholds mentioned re: pH levels and N20 emissions"

Transient Social-Ecological Stability: the Effects of Invasive Species and Ecosystem Restoration on Nutrient Management Compromise in Lake Erie,Roy,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,2010,GV,coastWQReg,1,"Ecosystem function / service -> abiotic drivers,Ecosystem function -> service providers",No,"Really difficult paper to code, it doesn't fit our structure very well. They had two models, one for the lake ecology and one for the management practices. The two models were linked, such that lake ecology influenced management and vice versa. Neither had 'response variables' as they were exploring the stability of the state of the system. Cool feedbacks example, but complicated modeling and they didn't actually measure services in the way we were expecting.",,
Organic farming and host density affect parasitism rates of tortricid moths in vineyards,Rusch,AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,2015,JL,PestPath,1,Ecosystem services -> service providers,No,"Feedbacks are complicated: they quantify parisitoids as a metric of biocontrol success and ask how land/use management affect parisitoids. Although they do not look at the effect of parasitoids on pest occupancy/health directly (meaning it is not an ESP DRIVER here), it could still be considered an ESP conceptually; and they DO look at how at how a separate ES metric (pest abundance) affects parisitioids... i.e. ES effect on ESP.",,
Identifying suitable multifunctional restoration areas for Forest Landscape Restoration in Central Chile,Schulz,ECOSPHERE,2017,CW,ClimReg; HabCreate; SoilProtect,3,No feedbacks measured directly,Yes,"Explanatory variables they started with: 8 biophysical extracted from raster maps + 18 bioclimatic variables from WorldClim raster dataset + 4 socio-econ variables. Removed correlated variables from models. Drives don't have a quantifiable direction (at least in what's presented) because end result of modeling is a wall to wall map showing levels of ES, multifunctional hotspots, and restoration/regen suitability based on those underlying drivers.",Unclear if they really identified strong drivers of ES.. may exclude if determined to only be landscape valuation,

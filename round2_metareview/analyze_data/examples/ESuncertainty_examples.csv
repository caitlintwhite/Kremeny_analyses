Applying network theory to prioritize multispecies habitat networks that are robust to climate and land-use change,Albert,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,2017,AK/GV,"GV: Simulated/modeled multiple scenarios of climate and land use change into the future, which provided a range of potential outcomes.",,just modeled habitat connectivity as EF but didn't really scale up to ES,

Recovery Debts Can Be Revealed by Ecosystem Network-Based Approaches,Dubois,ECOSYSTEMS,2019,CW,Yes! Authors add uncertainty distributions to each model parameter and run 1000 monte carlo simulations for each model per time period. These were done to put confidence limits on the ecosystem network output indicator values.,"This is a cool paper, very relevant to the Kremen framework (and they didn't cite Kremen!). Study revolves around network analysis so don't quantify effect sizes of much (what Q12 gets at)... this may be a limitation of our survey instrument (i.e. this survey form) for scoring papers like these (that do model complexity, whole ecosystem networks). Authors didn't state which ecosystem service they were modeling (as reflected in Q12), but I think this could apply to either energy or maintenance of options. Indicator values and biomass modeled by site (fore reef or lagoon) and by species, functional or trophic group, recovery debt estimated for entire ecosystem based on difference indicator metrics.",uses ecosystem network approach to asses recovery in coral reef ecosystem - includes % loss in cycling efficiency and transfer efficiency,
Functional diversity in cover crop polycultures increases multifunctionality of an agricultural system,Finney,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,2017,SDJ,"in their models, they saw that a small amount of variance in multifunctionality provision was explained by cover crop richness, but more variance was explained by functional diversity of the cover crops",,,

Performance of salmon fishery portfolios across western North America,Griffiths,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,2014,JL/TK,"TK: this paper's main focus was trying to partition the variability in performance across the whole ""portfolio"" of salmon stocks to variance or covariance",,,
"Assessing and mapping of multiple ecosystem services in Guizhou Province, China",Han,TROPICAL ECOLOGY,2017,TK/JL,JL: Minimal discussion of uncertainty in the modeling-heavy InVEST approach.,"JL: I did not note direction of driver effects if there were multiple different drivers considered (e.g., precip and evaporation as different environmental drivers) or if the driver was categorical (and consequently, lacked directionality)",,
From Field Data to Ecosystem Services Maps: Using Regressions for the Case of Deforested Areas Within the Amazon,Le Clec'h,ECOSYSTEMS,2018,LD,"In this paper, we aimed to improve scientific knowledge about the impacts of deforestation activities. To do so, we identified factors of control of a large set of ES indicators and developed maps of these indicators. The resulting maps showed variations in ES supply in a context of deforestation front and enabled better understanding of envi- ronmental challenges in these areas. For example, most of the maps presented highlighted a site effect.",,,
Regional-scale scenario modeling for coral reefs: a decision support tool to inform management of a complex system,Melbourne-Thomas,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,2011,SDJ,discusses three types of uncertainty in detail without quantification,"the model incorporates bits of each of the drivers (hurricanes, nutrification, sedimentation, without emphasis on specific drivers of those forces).",,
Evaluation of a new method for assessing resilience in urban aquatic social-ecological systems,Moores,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,2017,SDJ,mentioned once,,"Close to being a tools paper or a risk assessment paper, but retained because it attempts to link management scenarios to ES outcomes",
Assessing Resilience in Stressed Watersheds,Nemec,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,2014,NBD,includes it in their predictive model,"resiliance is a metric based on: ecological variability, diversity, modularity, acknowledgement of slow variables, tight feedbacks, social capital, innovation, overlap in governance, and ecosystem services.",,
"Mapping spatial non-stationarity of human-natural factors associated with agricultural landscape multifunctionality in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, China",Peng,AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,2017,JL,Explicitly dedicated a portion of the discussion to sources of uncertainty,"Note for the ES-Driver table, the paper actually looked at the effect of the drivers on MULTIFUNCTIONALITY (a composite of all the listed ES's) rather than focusing on individual relationships between drivers and services",multifunctionality in agricultural landscapes,
Identifying suitable multifunctional restoration areas for Forest Landscape Restoration in Central Chile,Schulz,ECOSPHERE,2017,CW,"Talk about uncertainties and simplifications that underlie large scale modeling in the discussion, but don't do anything to assess","Explanatory variables they started with: 8 biophysical extracted from raster maps + 18 bioclimatic variables from WorldClim raster dataset + 4 socio-econ variables. Removed correlated variables from models. Drives don't have a quantifiable direction (at least in what's presented) because end result of modeling is a wall to wall map showing levels of ES, multifunctional hotspots, and restoration/regen suitability based on those underlying drivers.",Unclear if they really identified strong drivers of ES.. may exclude if determined to only be landscape valuation,
From the stand scale to the landscape scale: predicting the spatial patterns of forest regeneration after disturbance,Shive,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,2018,AIS,they discuss sources of uncertainty in their models,,,
Mapping social-ecological vulnerability to inform local decision making,Thiault,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,2018,CW,"Conducted uncertainty analysis on their vulnerability indices by using different assumptions in their models (that included different math transformations on data [main model presented had a lot of log transformations], different aggregation formulas [e.g. if aggregated at something different that district or municipality], or if used different weighting scheme for indicators that go into the indices)","Paper talks about feedbacks but doesn't measure them directly. The way Q12 is structured doesn't seem well suited to capture studies like this one that provide wall-to-wall maps of ES's/resilience/vulnerability. Because it's a spatial study, it inherently addresses scale, but it's also tricky to answer Q9 for this (e.g. there are no ""plots""). Ecological vulnerability and social vulnerability are not correlated in the same way consistently across space. The authors use indices for all three response variables of interest (socio-ecological vulnerability, ecol. vulnerability, and social vulnerability) with multiple factors underlying those indices. Ecological resilience index is based on a normalized ""intrinsic vulnerability to fishing index"" [from another model] and fish assemblage data; socio indices based on 11 indicator that they lumped into 5 components (spatial mobility, materials assets, occupational mobility, attachment, and education). All response indices are on a 0 to 1 (low to high) scale. A reader would have to dig into the supplemental material and references to fully understand how and which data are used, how models work, etc.",,
Machine learning for ecosystem services,Willcock,ECOSYSTEM SERVICES,2018,AIS,used Bayesian network methods as uncertainty metrics describing machine learning model fit and grid0cell uncertainty can be calculated. Uncertainty can be propogated using Bayesian methods,,"the paper focuses on machine learning but provides two case studies of ecosystem services, so may still be appropriate",

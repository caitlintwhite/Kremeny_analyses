The study included lakes that were naturally acidified and lakes that were acidified due to human activity. It also included lakes that were limed by humans and ones that were not. So water quality was determined by natural and human causes. They were particularly interested in the human-caused liming. The human driver relationship was mixed because adding lime to lakes that were naturally acidified seemed to cause negative changes in community structure. Adding lime to lakes that were acidified due to human use probably had neutral to beneficial impacts from a management standpoint (water quality). For food and feed, the fisheries potential is responding to the community structure/water quality/human liming. They estimate fisheries potential from occurrence of valuable fish species.

Checked ""population growth"" in Q12 because seemed close enough to lakeshore development. The point of this paper is that increased lakeshore development creates dependence on DNR fish stocking to support recreational ES of system (wild fish in lake have lower survival rate). Paper also related lakeshore development to cost and profits the state takes in, but did not record that in Q12 as it's more social-science than ecology (but this paper aims to do full socio-economic assessment).",Attempts to link human driver (lakeshore development) to fisheries ES,

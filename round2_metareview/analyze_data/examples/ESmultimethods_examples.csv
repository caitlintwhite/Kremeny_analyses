The Swiss agri-environment scheme enhances pollinator diversity and plant reproductive success in nearby intensively managed farmland,Albrecht,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,2007,CW,Experimental; Observational (Includes data observed in situ OR via remote sensing if used directly),2,"Response vars for plant reproductive success are seed set per plant, fruit set per plant, and seed mass (only 2 slots available for responses). Choose food/fuel as relevant ES in Q12 because looking at plant repo success with respect to ag and conservation benefits. Overall study looks at mgmt type relationship with pollinator richness and diversity (broken down into pollinator guilds), mgmt type relationship with plant reproductive success, and correlation between plant reproduction and pollinator diversity; also looks at influence of distance from improved mgmt type on all of the response variables.",,

Recovery Debts Can Be Revealed by Ecosystem Network-Based Approaches,Dubois,ECOSYSTEMS,2019,CW,Model/Data Simulation; Observational (Includes data observed in situ OR via remote sensing if used directly),2,"This is a cool paper, very relevant to the Kremen framework (and they didn't cite Kremen!).

Organic farming promotes biotic resistance to foodborne human pathogens,Jones,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,2019,CW,Experimental; Observational (Includes data observed in situ OR via remote sensing if used directly),2,"Everything measured in this study, even soil community biodiversity, is in relation to potential to mitigate pathogen spread to food through feces in crop fields (i.e. it's all about food safety risk). So only counting y-vars towards soil protection ES (e.g. not counting diversity response towards maintenance of options ES). The general result is organic farming improves below ground beetle diversity, greater beetle diversity associated with more feces removal, reduced E. coli levels. Farm management levels are conventional, organic, and integrated. They have an SEM for above and below ground farm mgmt-beetle-soil content-feces relationships.",,
Using citizen scientists to measure an ecosystem service nationwide,Kaartinen,ECOLOGY,2013,LD/TK,Experimental; Observational (Includes data observed in situ OR via remote sensing if used directly),2,"LD: For the time question, they sampled multiple points (days) over the course of the experiment - 6 sample points in 60 days. They were trying to tease apart taxon-specific effects. Interesting: The current observations of the impact of dor beetles offer large-scale proof for previous findings obtained at smaller spatial scales: that dung beetle species of high body mass may be disproportionately important for sustaining an overall ecosystem service in both temper- ate (Rosenlew and Roslin 2008) and tropical regions (Larsen et al. 2005, Slade et al. 2007, 2011). The fate of a major ecosystem service may then hinge disproportion- ately on the fate of individual, large-sized species—a finding with profound consequences for conservation priorities. Overall, we note that our general approach of estimating functional contributions of decomposer taxa as differences in mass among dung pats to which they had vs. lacked access relies on the explicit assumption that relevant taxa were present across sites. For pat- dwelling dung beetles in the genus Aphodius, this assumption was verified through direct sampling of five bait pats (see above and Appendix B). For earthworms and dor beetles, the sampling techniques employed will suffice to establish neither their presence nor their abundance. ****FLAG AS AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO SCALE UP ES RESEARCH - citizen science experiments *****",,For LD review only: Reclass 'other' method; For TK review only: Dissolved TK clean answer into LD clean answer

Mapping social-ecological vulnerability to inform local decision making,Thiault,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,2018,CW,Model/Data Simulation; Observational (Includes data observed in situ OR via remote sensing if used directly),2,"Paper talks about feedbacks but doesn't measure them directly. The way Q12 is structured doesn't seem well suited to capture studies like this one that provide wall-to-wall maps of ES's/resilience/vulnerability. Because it's a spatial study, it inherently addresses scale, but it's also tricky to answer Q9 for this (e.g. there are no ""plots""). Ecological vulnerability and social vulnerability are not correlated in the same way consistently across space. The authors use indices for all three response variables of interest (socio-ecological vulnerability, ecol. vulnerability, and social vulnerability) with multiple factors underlying those indices. Ecological resilience index is based on a normalized ""intrinsic vulnerability to fishing index"" [from another model] and fish assemblage data; socio indices based on 11 indicator that they lumped into 5 components (spatial mobility, materials assets, occupational mobility, attachment, and education). All response indices are on a 0 to 1 (low to high) scale.

# internal use R script to prep data and EML metadata for publication
# author(s): CTW
# questions?: caitlin.t.white@colorado.eduy
# date init: 2022-05-07

# script purpose:
# we should publish 2 datasets:
# 1. all abstracts and full text excluded with reasons and citation info
# 2. full text studies retained, with qualtrics data used for analyses, and citation info
# > #2 is our "map database" (anyone interested in particular aspects our our survey could filter studies based on coding responses)

# use GV's Land cover Land Use change code to recode drivers and exclude LULC only
# > add those LULC-excluded studies to the exclusion dataset
# > be sure changed LULC drivers have QA note added

# specific mods for LULC:
# [1] Anything Q12 driver clean_answer with clean_answer_binned “land use and land cover change” should have the driver type changed to “LU_LC”
# > CTW to-do: assign new internal survey order numbers, reassign effect direct answer to LU_LC as needed
# [2] If Q14 ESP_type is “Only land use or habitat proxy”, reassign driver type from biotic to “LU_LC”.
# > CTW to-do: Also reassign effect direct to LU_LC; review what individual driver variables were entered in biotic in this case (were indicated as land use or habitat proxies)
# [3] After LU_LC reassignment, if only driver in study is LU_LC exclude.
# > CTW to-do: Add these excluded papers (GV found 26) to the excluded papers dataset with reason (Only driver in study is land use or land cover as a proxy).

# once datasets prepped with citation info and unecessary columns removed (e.g., anything internal use not critical to publish), write metadata with EML package
# write out all to main level of "publish" subfolder

# -- SETUP -----
rm(list = ls()) # start w clean environment (ctw does not care this is not best practice code)
# load needed libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(EML)
options(stringsAsFactors = F)
na_vals = c(NA, "NA", " ", "", ".")

# read in relevant datasets
datpath <- "round2_metareview/data/cleaned/"
# cleaned round 2 data (still need to convert LULC)
r2keep <- read.csv(paste0(datpath, "ESqualtrics_r2keep_cleaned.csv"), na.strings = na_vals)
# excluded papers with reasons
excluded <- read.csv(paste0(datpath, "ESreview_allexcluded_allrounds.csv"), na.strings = na_vals)
# citation info for all papers
citations <- read.csv("round1_exclusion/EcosystemServicesPapersNov2019.csv", na.strings = na_vals)

# how did all read in?
str(r2keep)
str(excluded)
str(citations) #ok


# -- TREAT LULC ----
# if driver is land use or land cover related, convert to that type of driver
# > reassign effect direction and create new internal survey order number for LULC to organize
# make sure treat in similar way to how GV and AK use so analysis code runs as is
